We seek to address this low employment rate through innovative research and on-the-ground demonstration programs across the nation. Current NOD programs benefit seriously injured service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, employers seeking to become more disability friendly, and high school students with disabilities who are transitioning into the workforce or higher education. &#xD;
&#xD;
For nearly three decades, NOD has been a galvanizing force, a clearinghouse of ideas and policy, and an authoritative voice for people with every kind of disability. NOD was the first organization ever to embrace the mission of representing all 54 million Americans with disabilities -- 20% of the population -- regardless of their particular condition or circumstances.&#xD;
