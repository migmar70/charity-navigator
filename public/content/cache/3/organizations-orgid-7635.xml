Grieving the death of his wife in childbirth, he wanted to help those in need. Now, 100 years later, it is the leading Catholic organization devoted exclusively to international health care.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last decade CMMB has provided more than $1 billion in support to millions of those in need in more than 100 countries through its HIV/AIDS, child survival, tropical diseases, donated medicines and volunteer programs. In 2011 more than 500,000 women, men and children were helped via its programs. Through strong relationships with leading pharmaceutical and medical supply companies, in 2011 CMMB secured donated products valued at more than $285 million for placement in resource-poor medical facilities throughout the world. Its volunteer program, in the last decade, has placed thousands of long-and short-term volunteers in resource-poor hospitals and clinics throughout the world&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving into its second century, CMMB's work is embodied in its Strategic Plan, which has as its ultimate goal the strengthening of health systems in six key ways:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-	Increasing access to health services &lt;br&gt;-	Strengthening the global health care work force &lt;br&gt;-	Building supply chain capacity to increase access to medicine and technology &lt;br&gt;-	Helping health care facilities in the developing world build strong financial systems &lt;br&gt;-	Supporting program monitoring systems and key research to affirm and establish best practices &lt;br&gt;-	Increasing the ability of local health care leaders to design and manage programs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more about CMMB and its works, go to www.cmmb.org.
