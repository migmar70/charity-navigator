CAP is committed to sheltering, rescuing and placing homeless animals in loving homes. 39 years later, after operating in a strip center, CAP has moved into our very own animal shelter facility. CAP advocates respect and compassion for all animal life - we speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. CAP also provides humane education to prevent animal cruelty and raise awareness in the community of the needs of animals. To fulfill our mission, CAP has developed and established many successful programs and services to enhance the lives of pets and people in the Greater Houston Area and surrounding counties. Some of these programs are unique in Houston, such as our Weekend Sponsor Program and our Feral Cat Assistance Program.</mission><charity_name>Citizens for Animal Protection</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Linda Schmuck</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6090</orgid><administration_expenses>178546.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.076000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Houston</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>77094</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.182000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>61.460000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.044000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1924337.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.819000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.17</financial_score><street_address_1>17555 Katy Fwy</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Kappy Muenzer</current_ceo_name><ein>237296260</ein><total_expenses>2348702.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.104000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>6132713.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>245819.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Serving pets and people in the Greater Houston area since 1972</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.610000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6090/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
