We are a faith-based organization working primarily in developing nations, where an estimated 30 to 60 percent of health care is provided by such organizations. IMA procures and distributes medication and supplies to clinics and hospitals; helps to treat, prevent, and control diseases, some of which have been virtually eliminated in the developed world; and supports education and training for health care professionals, community volunteers, and families.</mission><charity_name>IMA World Health</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Tim McCully</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3877</orgid><administration_expenses>2558831.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.031000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New Windsor</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>21776</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.143000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>52.710000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.163000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>78296360.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.965000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>48.17</financial_score><street_address_1>500 Main Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Building Old Main</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Richard Santos</current_ceo_name><ein>522112460</ein><total_expenses>81135142.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.003000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>13983051.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>279951.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Advancing health and healing for vulnerable and marginalized people</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.170000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3877/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
