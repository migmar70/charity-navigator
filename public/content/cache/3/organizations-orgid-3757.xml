Even more important than the volume of goods we ship is the care we take to send recipients only items they can readily use. Volunteers and staff spend hours sorting and processing donated materials. Hospital furnishings are cleaned and repaired, or refinished if necessary, to give these items a second life. Through the Suture Donation Program, hospitals around the world receive an annual allotment of suture, a critical medical supply that is all too often lacking in hospitals around the world. Through our Country Programs, Global Links develops ongoing relationships with healthcare facilities in specific countries.</mission><charity_name>Global Links</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director &amp; Co-Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mimi Falbo</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3757</orgid><administration_expenses>171818.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.034000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Pittsburgh</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>15224    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.072000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>55.540000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>PA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.083000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>4813641.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.956000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>49.56</financial_score><street_address_1>4809 Penn Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>2nd Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Kathleen Hower</current_ceo_name><ein>521629060</ein><total_expenses>5034048.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.009000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>3318725.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>48589.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Sharing surplus.
