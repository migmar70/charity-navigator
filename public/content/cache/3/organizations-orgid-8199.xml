Boomer Esiason was a star NFL quarterback in 1993 when he learned his young son, Gunnar, was afflicted with the deadly disease cystic fibrosis. Boomer and his wife, Cheryl, are strongly committed to supporting the critical research needed to discover a cure for CF and to improving the quality of life for the 30,000 Americans living with the disease.
