We educate parents, support protective policies, and engage communities to make responsible decisions, simple everyday choices, and well-informed lifestyle improvements to create healthy environments where children and families can flourish. Our goals include expanding awareness and understanding of environmental hazards to children's health; helping the public learn about healthier practices, solutions, and products in the marketplace; creating standards and policies for safer products, foods, materials, and chemicals used in the home; and advocating for and support corporate policies and governmental legislation that protect children from environmental risks.</mission><charity_name>Healthy Child Healthy World</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Rene Jones</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7788</orgid><administration_expenses>39578.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.043000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Environment</category><city>Los Angeles</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>90025</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.061000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.160000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Environmental Protection and Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.001000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>823131.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.900000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>43.53</financial_score><street_address_1>10675 Santa Monica Blvd</street_address_1><accountability_score>67.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Gigi Lee Chang</current_ceo_name><ein>223665574</ein><total_expenses>914272.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.056000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>379237.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>51563.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Creating healthy environments where children and families can flourish</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.410000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7788/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
