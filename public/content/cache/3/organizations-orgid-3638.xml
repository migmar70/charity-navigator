We bring about far-reaching change by enforcing and strengthening environmental laws on behalf of hundreds of organizations, coalitions and communities. Established as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in 1971, Earthjustice has a legal staff of more than 50 in eight offices around the country. Earthjustice uses federal and state environmental laws to protect the environment by taking government agencies to court for failing to enforce our nation's environmental laws, and corporations for breaking them. Earthjustice does this work on behalf of hundreds of community and environmental groups, providing legal services free of charge.</mission><charity_name>Earthjustice</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Ed Lewis</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3638</orgid><administration_expenses>2645211.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.090000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Environment</category><city>San Francisco</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94111</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.055000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.940000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Environmental Protection and Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.066000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>22349434.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.760000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>59.28</financial_score><street_address_1>50 California Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 500</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Trip Van Noppen</current_ceo_name><ein>941730465</ein><total_expenses>29369765.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.148000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>41256850.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>4375120.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Because the earth needs a good lawyer</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.350000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3638/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
