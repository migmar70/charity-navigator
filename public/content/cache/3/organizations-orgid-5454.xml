IJ litigates to secure economic liberty, school choice, private property rights, freedom of speech and other vital individual liberties and to restore constitutional limits on the power of government. IJ provides legal counsel to inner-city entrepreneurs, because their freedom to shape their own businesses directly affects their freedom to shape their own lives and communities. In addition, IJ trains law students, lawyers, policy activists and grassroots organizers in the tactics of public interest litigation and advocacy for liberty. Through these activities, IJ challenges the ideology of the welfare state and illustrates and extends the benefits of freedom to those whose full enjoyment of liberty is denied by government.</mission><charity_name>Institute for Justice</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and General Counsel</current_ceo_title><cob_name>David Kennedy</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5454</orgid><administration_expenses>1112540.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.101000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Arlington</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>22203</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.253000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>67.500000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>VA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Advocacy and Civil Rights</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.080000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>8883717.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.813000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.13</financial_score><street_address_1>901 North Glebe Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>67.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 900</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>William H.
