Hope For The Warriors&#xC2;&#xAE; is dedicated to restoring a sense of self, restoring the family unit, and restoring hope for our service members and our military families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On their own, our service members and their families are awe inspiring in the face of their disabilities and hardships - courageous and resolute. However, it is with the support of a grateful nation that they remain unfaltering in their determination and find hope and purpose beyond recovery. As a united support network, all individuals, whether of great or small means, can find an opportunity to honor those who have willingly sacrificed to defend and protect our freedom. To accomplish our mission, we have designed special programs that allow and encourage community involvement.</mission><charity_name>Hope For The Warriors&#xC2;&#xAE;</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President/CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jack W.
