CAS fills the gaps between what children deserve and what life has dealt them. We have been serving children for more than 150 years, a longevity that is a testament to our ability to adapt to the always changing needs of today's youth. Today CAS serves more than 150,000 children and their families at more than 45 sites throughout New York City.</mission><charity_name>The Children's Aid Society</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mark M.
