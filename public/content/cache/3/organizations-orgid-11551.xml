We empower and mobilize people to give hope and facilitate change for children around the world. Through our programs and services we seek to provide a better life for children, within their family of origin, within their country of origin or with a forever family through adoption.&lt;br&gt;For more than 20 years, we have been helping children and families around the world. Since 1991, we have united more than 2,500 children with their forever families and we currently complete approximately 200 adoptions each year.&lt;br&gt;Through our orphan care and missions programs we serve thousands of orphans each year, helping provide the shelter, care and love that every child deserves. In cooperation with local ministries and community organizations, AGCI serves orphan children in Bulgaria, China, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Haiti, Rwanda, and Taiwan.</mission><charity_name>All God's Children International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mariah Gray Kolpek</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11551</orgid><administration_expenses>350113.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.072000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Portland</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>97232</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.001000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>49.790000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>OR</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.018000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>4310938.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.892000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>42.29</financial_score><street_address_1>3308 Northeast Peerless Place</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Hollen Frazier</current_ceo_name><ein>931052909</ein><total_expenses>4829028.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.034000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>250806.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>167977.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Adoption | Orphan Care | Missions</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.050000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11551/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
