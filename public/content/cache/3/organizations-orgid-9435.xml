FAME seeks to lead people to Christ and meet real physical needs by partnering with other mission organizations to deliver a unique combination of medical mission services providing: desperately needed medical facilities; life saving and sustaining medicines and medical supplies; and hands-on care through medically focused short-term mission teams. With the needs of many missionaries continuing to grow, FAME is available to be used by God as a conduit for medicine, funding, and the sending of medical personnel on short-term trips where they are needed most. FAME is committed to coming alongside missionaries and mission organizations to help provide oversight for the medical aspect of things in order that the door may be opened wide for the message of the Gospel.</mission><charity_name>FAME</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Richard Berger</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9435</orgid><administration_expenses>455484.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.245000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Indianapolis</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>46203</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.200000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>50.170000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.213000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1292449.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.696000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>41.96</financial_score><street_address_1>4545 Southeastern Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Bill Warren</current_ceo_name><ein>237124787</ein><total_expenses>1854559.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.057000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1172121.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>106626.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Partnering in medical evangelism</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.630000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9435/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
