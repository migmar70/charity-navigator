We do this by providing food, shelter, medical care, children's Bibles, educational assistance, adoption services and more in a manner that breaks the cycle of dependence and promotes individual and societal productivity as well as charitable character within the community. We get results that are both measurable, effective and efficient and provide evidence and security to our doors through our reporting, due diligence and on-going assessments of the orphan children's homes we provide for.</mission><charity_name>Orphan's Lifeline of Hope International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, Co-Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10946</orgid><administration_expenses>145631.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.113000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Kalispell</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>59901</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.005000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>39.850000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MT</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.003000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>1126586.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.881000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>50.67</financial_score><street_address_1>135 Kelly Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>32.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>David Board</current_ceo_name><ein>810530827</ein><total_expenses>1277916.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.004000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>244301.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>5700.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Bringing hope to the orphans of the world</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.190000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>0</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10946/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
