The first team went out in 1971 and since that time over 42,000 North American youth have assisted with a variety of evangelistic and building projects with over 200 established missions in over 110 countries. We exist to launch youth into lifetime missions involvement by training, discipling and mobilizing them to impact eternity around the world. A large number of our alumni are in full-time Christian ministry serving the Lord worldwide as pastors, teachers, Christian authors and missionaries.</mission><charity_name>Teen Missions International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8108</orgid><administration_expenses>291433.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.089000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>Merritt Island</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>0</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>32953</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.022000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>39.280000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>0</loanstoofficers><state>FL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.063000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>2884503.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.890000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.66</financial_score><street_address_1>885 East Hall Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>29.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Robert Bland</current_ceo_name><ein>237125177</ein><total_expenses>3240565.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.019000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>6454875.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>64629.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Training tomorrow's missionaries today</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.990000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>0</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8108/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
