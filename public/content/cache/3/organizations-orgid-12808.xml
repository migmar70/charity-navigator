To accomplish this goal, Jamestown employs very intricate strategies. First, we use well-researched youth development theory and practice as the underlying framework for program design, implementation, and evaluation. This approach emphasizes young people's resiliency in the face of challenges and recognizes their natural urge to grow up to be successful adults. Second, we offer youth the opportunity to participate in Jamestown year after year, from age 0 to 18. To deepen their engagement, youth are encouraged to join more than one Jamestown program. Ultimately, we hope to watch these youth graduate from both high school and from Jamestown.</mission><charity_name>The Jamestown Community Center</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Betty Pazmi&#xC3;&#xB1;o</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12808</orgid><administration_expenses>149536.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.092000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>San Francisco</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94110</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.034000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>50.250000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Youth Development, Shelter, and Crisis Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.027000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1348257.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.832000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>44.34</financial_score><street_address_1>3382 26th Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Claudia Jasin</current_ceo_name><ein>943213124</ein><total_expenses>1619882.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.075000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>176383.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>122089.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing youth with positive experiences</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.100000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12808/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
