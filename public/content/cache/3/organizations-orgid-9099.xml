It is also the only multi-disease camp and family care center of its kind on the West Coast. Through educational, therapeutic, safe, and just plain fun summer camp and year-round programs, The Painted Turtle provides a life-changing experience to children whose daily struggles often diminish both their desire to be well and their ability to lead a rich, productive life. The Painted Turtle offers an exhilarating, challenging, and nurturing array of traditional summer camp recreational activities, seamlessly intertwined with programs that inspire children to become more self-confident and self-reliant, as well as more cooperative with their medical caregivers.</mission><charity_name>The Painted Turtle</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Page Adler</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9099</orgid><administration_expenses>765203.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.143000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Santa Monica</city><cob_title>Founder, Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>90401</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.180000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.810000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Patient and Family Support</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.012000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>4154935.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.776000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>45.26</financial_score><street_address_1>1300 Fourth Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 300</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Blake Maher</current_ceo_name><ein>954612481</ein><total_expenses>5348188.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.080000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>27910763.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>428050.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>A Serious Fun camp</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>5.150000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9099/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
