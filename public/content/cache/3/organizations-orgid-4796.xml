Strengthened by diversity, the YWCA draws together members who strive to create opportunities for women's growth, leadership, and power in order to attain a common vision: peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all people. The YWCA is the oldest and largest multicultural women's organization in the world. Across the globe, we have more than 25 million members in 106 countries, including 2.6 million members and participants in 300 local associations in the United States. More important than the numbers, is our mission to eliminate racism and empower women. We provide safe places for women and girls, build strong women leaders, and advocate for women's rights and civil rights in Congress.</mission><charity_name>YWCA USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Interim CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Rebecca Hall</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4796</orgid><administration_expenses>2493338.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.595000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20036</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.008000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>20.250000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Multipurpose Human Service Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.252000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>0</overall_rating><program_expenses>1369889.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.327000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>0.00</financial_score><street_address_1>1015 Eighteenth Street, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1100</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Gloria Lau</current_ceo_name><ein>131624103</ein><total_expenses>4188043.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>0</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.077000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>57274317.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>324816.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Eliminating racism, empowering women</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>12.160000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4796/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
