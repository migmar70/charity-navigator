Damaged extensively in a flood, the Warner was slated for demolition in the early 1980s until Northwest Connecticut Association for the Arts (NCAA) was founded and purchased the theatre. The Warner reopened as a performing arts center in 1983, and restoration of the lobbies and auditorium was completed in November 2002. Today, the Warner is in operation year-round and serves nearly 100,000 patrons with 165+ public performances annually. NCAA's mission is to preserve the Warner Theatre as an historic landmark, enhance its reputation as a center of artistic excellence and a focal point of community involvement, and satisfy the diverse cultural needs of the region.</mission><charity_name>Warner Theatre</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Ken Merz</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8920</orgid><administration_expenses>387930.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.086000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>Torrington</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>06790</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.046000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.790000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CT</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Performing Arts</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.059000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3748005.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.832000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>49.07</financial_score><street_address_1>68 Main Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>55.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>P.O.
