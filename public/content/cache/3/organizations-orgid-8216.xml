Throughout the children's instruction, dance classes, shoes and leotards are provided free of charge. During the first year of training, transportation is provided while students attend ballet classes on a school-time release program. Students who show the talent and passion required to study classical ballet are invited to attend The New York City Public School for Dance (NYCPSD) - a cooperative, tuition-free venture between the NYC Department of Education and Ballet Tech. The School offers a rigorous academic curriculum paired with intensive dance training for students in grades four through twelve.</mission><charity_name>Ballet Tech Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Artistic Director, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Eliot Feld</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8216</orgid><administration_expenses>344748.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.116000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10003</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0E-15</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>48.510000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Performing Arts</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.033000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>2376582.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.806000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>49.04</financial_score><street_address_1>890 Broadway</street_address_1><accountability_score>48.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Eliot Feld</current_ceo_name><ein>132773475</ein><total_expenses>2947945.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.076000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>5384499.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>226615.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Presenting professional ballet and training tomorrow's dancers</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.820000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>0</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8216/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
