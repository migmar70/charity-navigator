Established in 1987, Shelter Network has evolved and is now regarded as the largest and most comprehensive provider of housing and supportive services for homeless families and individuals in San Mateo County. Today, Shelter Network operates six primary shelters and numerous scattered-site housing programs from Daly City to East Palo Alto, CA. Services include emergency and transitional housing, case management, individual and group counseling, job and housing search referrals and assistance, life and job skills training, free child care, and more. During fiscal year 2009-10, Shelter Network served nearly 4,400 people, including over 1,700 children. Notably, 91% of families and single adults who completed Shelter Network's transitional housing programs succeeded in returning to permanent housing after an average stay of just 100 days. Shelter Network's programs are possible through a balanced combination of funding and support from public and private sources as well as volunteer help.</mission><charity_name>Shelter Network</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chair</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mike McCall</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8790</orgid><administration_expenses>899559.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.113000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Burlingame</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94010</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.075000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>64.570000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Homeless Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.087000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>6368367.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.806000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>66.86</financial_score><street_address_1>1450 Chapin Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>2nd Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Christine Krolik</current_ceo_name><ein>770160469</ein><total_expenses>7893783.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.079000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>12299234.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>625857.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping homeless families and individuals return to a place that they can call "home."</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.550000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8790/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
