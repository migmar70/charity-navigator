Funding of a 4 Paws' service dog is the responsibility of the applicant. Applicants typically use fund-raising activities to gather these funds, and 4 Paws assists the applicant as necessary. 4 Paws provides a wide range of funding options, and has no eligibility requirements beyond a physician statement that the person requesting a service dog has a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.</mission><charity_name>4 Paws for Ability </charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Garrett Ethridge</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>13055</orgid><administration_expenses>126909.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.093000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Xenia</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>45385</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.069000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>56.320000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>OH</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Social Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.152000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1064194.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.780000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>57.80</financial_score><street_address_1>207 Dayton Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>55.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Karen Shirk</current_ceo_name><ein>311625484</ein><total_expenses>1362764.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.125000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>507539.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>171661.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing canine miracles for people with disabilities worldwide</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.370000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/13055/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
