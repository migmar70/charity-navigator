Primarily known for its work with homeless and chemically dependent men, the Mission also has a long history of providing practical assistance for women and children. We provide comprehensive support services and education programs focused on techniques and habits for promoting long-term success. Our investment in each person is a precursor of his or her own investment in a more vibrant future. Our goal is to encourage people to value themselves as God values them, to see the value they have to offer the world, and to seek out a bright future as a fully contributing member of our community.</mission><charity_name>Union Gospel Mission, Twin Cities</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Carl Schmuland</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7018</orgid><administration_expenses>706849.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.053000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>St. Paul</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>55101</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.113000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>57.220000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Homeless Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.101000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>9897678.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.746000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>54.96</financial_score><street_address_1>77 East Ninth Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>60.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Ken Peterson</current_ceo_name><ein>410705847</ein><total_expenses>13262490.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.200000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>17330319.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>2657963.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Our mission is changing lives</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.240000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7018/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
