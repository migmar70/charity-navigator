Ohr Somayach began over thirty years ago as a response to the desire of a handful of young people who wanted to learn more about Judaism. It quickly grew to be not only a sensitive respondent to the needs of the Jewish community, but an active initiator of new and innovative educational programs around the world. Ohr Somayach's involvement in mass media has included Shma Yisrael magazine; film, radio and television programs; slide shows and video productions; computer software; and a series of books and publications entitled Jerusalem Echoes. These endeavors have helped crystallize and project Ohr Somayach as an innovative force in Jewish education.</mission><charity_name>Ohr Somayach International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4257</orgid><administration_expenses>96354.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.027000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>Brooklyn</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>11230    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.125000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>38.110000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.137000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>3259149.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.941000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>44.22</financial_score><street_address_1>1399 Coney Island Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>33.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Neil Schiller</current_ceo_name><ein>133503155</ein><total_expenses>3462819.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.030000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>391232.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>107316.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing religious, educational and charitable aid to North American and Israeli institutions</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.110000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4257/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
