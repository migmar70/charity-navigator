ARF saves dogs and cats who have run out of time at public shelters and brings people and animals together to enrich each others' lives. ARF strives to create a world where every loving dog and cat has a home, where every lonely person has a companion animal, and where children learn to care. ARF is an organization that can not only aid abandoned and homeless animals, but also promote the concept that people's lives can be enhanced by strengthening the bonds between humans and animals.</mission><charity_name>Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Tony La Russa</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5636</orgid><administration_expenses>196774.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.042000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Walnut Creek</city><cob_title>Co-founder, Chairman of the Board                 </cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94598</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.038000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.340000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.003000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>4212157.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.909000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>56.34</financial_score><street_address_1>2890 Mitchell Drive</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Elena Bicker</current_ceo_name><ein>680240341</ein><total_expenses>4631640.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.048000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>21946868.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>222709.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>People rescuing animals . . .animals rescuing people</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>4.390000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5636/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
