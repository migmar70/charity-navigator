PLF is devoted to a vision of individual freedom, responsible government, and color-blind justice. PLF's litigation focuses on three major projects: to defend the fundamental human right of private property; to promote sensible environmental policies that respect individual freedom and put people first; and to create a nation in which people are judged by the content of their character. In addition, PLF's Economic Liberty and Free Enterprise Projects are devoted to protecting the right to earn a living, and protect businesses against unfair burdens.</mission><charity_name>Pacific Legal Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>John C.
