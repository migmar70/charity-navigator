V-Day is a catalyst that promotes creative events to increase awareness, raise money and revitalize the spirit of existing anti-violence organizations. V-Day generates broader attention for the fight to stop violence against women and girls, including rape, battery, incest, female genital mutilation (FGM) and sexual slavery. Through V-Day campaigns, local volunteers and college students produce annual benefit performances of 'The Vagina Monologues and artistic works' to raise awareness and funds for anti-violence groups within their own communities. In addition V-Day stages large-scale benefits and produces innovative gatherings, films and campaigns to educate and change social attitudes towards violence against women.</mission><charity_name>V-Day</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Eve Ensler</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10309</orgid><administration_expenses>366300.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.104000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Playwright and V-Day Founder</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10010</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.233000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>66.980000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.186000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2983510.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.852000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.52</financial_score><street_address_1>303 Park Avenue South</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1184</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Susan Celia Swan</current_ceo_name><ein>943389430</ein><total_expenses>3499169.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.042000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>5293778.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>149359.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>A global movement to end violence against women and girls</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.510000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10309/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
