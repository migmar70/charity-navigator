Year Up's mission is to close the opportunity divide by providing urban young adults with the skills, experience, and support that will empower them to reach their potential through professional careers and higher education. We achieve this mission through a high support, high expectation model that combines marketable job skills, stipends, apprenticeships, college credit, a behavior management system and several levels of support to place these young adults on a viable path to economic self-sufficiency. Year Up currently serves more than 1,500 students a year at sites in Atlanta, Boston, Providence, New York City and Washington, D.C.</mission><charity_name>Year Up</charity_name><current_ceo_title>CEO, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Paul Salem</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10495</orgid><administration_expenses>2689015.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.086000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Education</category><city>Boston</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>02110</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.289000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>64.250000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Other Education Programs and Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.403000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>26105844.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.838000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>65.88</financial_score><street_address_1>93 Summer Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>5th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Gerald Chertavian</current_ceo_name><ein>043534407</ein><total_expenses>31152028.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.075000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>32050281.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>2357169.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Empowering urban talent to reach their potential</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.020000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10495/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
