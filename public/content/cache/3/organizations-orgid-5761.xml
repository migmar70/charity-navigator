The museum is dedicated to exhibiting and collecting Northwest art, with the mission of connecting people through art. The museum's permanent collection includes the premier collection of Dale Chihuly's glass artwork on permanent public display. Tacoma Art Museum serves the diverse communities of the Northwest through its collection, exhibitions, and learning programs, emphasizing art and artists from the Northwest. Our vision is to be a national model for regional museums by creating a dynamic museum that engages, inspires, and builds community through art.</mission><charity_name>Tacoma Art Museum</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Kathy McColdrick</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5761</orgid><administration_expenses>444890.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.100000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>Tacoma</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>98402</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.012000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.300000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>WA</state><reportsceoandsalary>0</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Museums</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.019000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3452667.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.782000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>51.61</financial_score><street_address_1>1701 Pacific Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>51.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Stephanie Stebich</current_ceo_name><ein>910697444</ein><total_expenses>4414257.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.117000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>35230133.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>516700.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Connecting people through art</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>7.310000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5761/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
