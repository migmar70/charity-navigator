We are currently involved in five medical works in West Africa. We operate a clinic and two hospitals in Nigeria. In Ghana, we work with two clinics, one in the northern part of the country and one in the south. IHCF African Christian Hospitals also hosts a medical missions seminar each January in Dallas. This is the largest and oldest medical missions conference in the Church of Christ fellowship. Many organizations, ministries, and individuals working around the globe attend to share ideas, information and fellowship.</mission><charity_name>IHCF African Christian Hospitals</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Dr. Hank Farrar</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5139</orgid><administration_expenses>44370.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.051000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Searcy</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>72143</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.038000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.530000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>AR</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.075000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>775009.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.893000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>66.33</financial_score><street_address_1>102 North Locust Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>47.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Tom Carr</current_ceo_name><ein>237258102</ein><total_expenses>867526.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.055000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1236274.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>48147.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Supporting medical mission points</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.350000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5139/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
