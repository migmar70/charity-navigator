We provide a hand up, not a hand out by offering adult education classes for women and educational enrichment programs for at-risk youth in the community, completely free of charge. All programs are designed to help these families succeed in the workplace and in the public education system. In the short twelve years since opening our doors, Oasis has grown from a soup kitchen serving meals to women and children to a safe haven where women living in extreme poverty are welcomed with open arms and encouraged to advance their education with the goal of becoming self-sufficient.</mission><charity_name>Oasis - A Haven for Women and Children</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jennifer Brady</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11564</orgid><administration_expenses>162375.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.093000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Paterson</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>07501</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.092000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.760000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NJ</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Children's and Family Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.001000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1429667.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.820000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.53</financial_score><street_address_1>59 Mill Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Sister Gloria Perez</current_ceo_name><ein>223491573</ein><total_expenses>1742521.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.086000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>3127146.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>150479.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Changing Lives One Woman and Child at a Time</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.790000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11564/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
