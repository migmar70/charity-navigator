Our focus is in strengthening families who have little resources, through our community-based, medical, educational, clean water, small business and agricultural programs in rural Nicaragua. The mission of Amigos for Christ is to serve the Lord by serving His poor. We accomplish this by providing nutrition, healthcare, education, spirituality and economic development through grassroots efforts, which enable us to enrich the lives of those in need, as well as the missionaries who represent us. We have provided over 19 million dollars in aid to the poor. Over 800 people a year travel to Nicaragua on mission trips with us. Working side by side with the native families, we bridge language and cultural barriers and offer hope and opportunity.</mission><charity_name>Amigos for Christ</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Susan LaFave</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8280</orgid><administration_expenses>126528.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.027000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Buford</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>30518</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.020000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.490000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>GA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.019000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>4382986.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.959000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.15</financial_score><street_address_1>1845 South Lee Court</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite A</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>John Bland</current_ceo_name><ein>582484257</ein><total_expenses>4568389.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.012000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>478736.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>58875.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Serving His poor</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.100000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8280/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
