AFCA provides critical AIDS and related medications, medical equipment and supplies, nutritional supplements, and emergency supplies that are requested by the institutions in its targeted areas. Currently, AFCA is working in Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe. AFCA is committed to combat HIV/AIDS by providing care for HIV+ children, their HIV+ guardians and HIV+ pregnant women. We do this by: partnering with reliable, community based programs; finding Americans who want to become long-term child sponsors; assisting access to care through support of Mulago Hospital, Mikindani Community Based Project, St. Mary's Hospitals, St. Joseph's Home of Hope, St. Theresa's Orphanage, and ZOE.</mission><charity_name>American Foundation For Children With AIDS</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Nick Cassino</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12734</orgid><administration_expenses>81680.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.013000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Harrisburg</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>17112</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.022000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>56.040000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>PA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.012000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>5636340.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.922000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>50.27</financial_score><street_address_1>6221 Blue Grass Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Tanya Weaver</current_ceo_name><ein>300247823</ein><total_expenses>6112572.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.064000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>440010.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>394552.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping children in Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe with HIV/AIDS</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.070000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12734/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
