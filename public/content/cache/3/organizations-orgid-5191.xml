All of this has been accomplished with the assistance of child sponsors. Approximately 100 elementary children are supported in three rural schools: Mont Mare Roseaux, Francois, and Duplan II. Support is also provided for 30 students at the Callebasse Vocational School. Since the mid 80's, mission trips to Haiti have also been conducted each year. Countless trips have been made emphasizing medical attention, construction, and many forms of evangelism.</mission><charity_name>FOCAS</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Courtnell Francois</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5191</orgid><administration_expenses>122311.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.161000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Cincinnati</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>45202</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.080000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>35.200000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>OH</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.070000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>591260.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.779000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>42.79</financial_score><street_address_1>64 East McMicken Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>29.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>2nd Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Richard P.
