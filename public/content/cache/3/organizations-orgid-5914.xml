Holt is dedicated to carrying out God's plan for every child to have a permanent, loving family. While children are waiting for permanent families, we place them with foster families where they will enjoy an attentive, family-like environment. In situations where we must use institutional care, we use a high ratio of childcare workers to children along with attentive childcare methods that ensure children receive physical and verbal affection and stimulation. Our ultimate goal is always to see the child safely, happily and permanently in the right loving home.</mission><charity_name>Holt International Children's Services</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jeff Saddington</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5914</orgid><administration_expenses>2268141.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.095000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Eugene</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>97402</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.077000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.990000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>OR</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Children's and Family Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.065000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>17851206.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.748000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>47.57</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
