Through the years, ELEM has grown and now operates programs in 40 cities and towns nationwide, with a variety of innovative and relevant programs targeted toward different population groups. ELEM reaches out to all populations of troubled, 'invisible' youth, including Arabs, Ultra Orthodox, young sex offenders, and immigrants from the Former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. Youth of all ages and from all backgrounds seek and receive help from ELEM. These youth need help integrating into existing frameworks and, sometimes, simply getting through their teen years.</mission><charity_name>ELEM/Youth in Distress in Israel</charity_name><current_ceo_title></current_ceo_title><cob_name>Ann Bialkin</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10011</orgid><administration_expenses>143976.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.106000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10016</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.107000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.190000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.120000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1019741.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.756000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.06</financial_score><street_address_1>270 Madison Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>48.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1501</street_address_2><current_ceo_name></current_ceo_name><ein>133171815</ein><total_expenses>1348478.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.137000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>692490.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>184761.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping Israel's population of at-risk youth become productive citizens</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.210000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10011/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
