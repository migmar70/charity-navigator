By studying the historical development of the Holocaust and other instances of collective violence, students learn to combat prejudice with compassion, indifference with ethical participation, myth and misinformation with knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Facing History and Ourselves has offered in-depth professional development services; curricular resources; and ongoing support to educators and students in the areas of history, social studies, and language arts. We are dedicated to helping teachers around the world lead their students in a critical examination of history, with particular focus on genocide and mass violence.</mission><charity_name>Facing History and Ourselves</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Klarman Family Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Seth A.
