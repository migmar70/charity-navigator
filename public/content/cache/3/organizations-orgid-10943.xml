The Foundation aims to educate children about the issue of domestic violence. In 2005, the Foundation opened its first school-based programming initiative, Margaret's Place, at Hostos-Lincoln Academy, Bronx, NY. Margaret's Place, a tribute to his mom, is a comprehensive program which provides students with a safe room in school where they can meet with a professional counselor trained in domestic-violence intervention and prevention. Currently there are ten fully funded and operational Margaret's Places in New York City and Westchester County.</mission><charity_name>Joe Torre Safe At Home Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Joe Torre</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10943</orgid><administration_expenses>296822.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.143000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10163</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.119000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.220000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Social Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.056000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1241298.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.601000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.62</financial_score><street_address_1>Grand Central Station</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>P.O.
