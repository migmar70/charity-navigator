RAM houses one of North America's most significant collections of contemporary crafts. With a permanent collection of more than 3,500 objects, half of these pieces represent the museum's focus on contemporary crafts from internationally recognized artists in ceramics, fibers, glass, metals and wood. Exhibitions at RAM emphasize ideas behind the artwork, rather than following strict media categories. RAM also plays a vital role in arts education through Wustum Museum, where it offers community outreach programs, studio art classes and workshops taught by regionally and nationally known artists working in craft media.</mission><charity_name>Racine Art Museum</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Stephanie Lazzeroni</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6999</orgid><administration_expenses>248470.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.139000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>Racine</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>53401</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.098000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>46.590000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>WI</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Museums</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.026000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1325216.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.743000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>40.00</financial_score><street_address_1>441 Main Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>56.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Bruce Pepich</current_ceo_name><ein>391018155</ein><total_expenses>1781708.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.116000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>13479122.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>208022.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Housing one of North America's most significant collections of contemporary crafts</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>4.690000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6999/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
