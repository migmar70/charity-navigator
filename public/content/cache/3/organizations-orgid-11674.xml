Our mission is to be a catalyst for long-lasting positive change in low- and moderate-income communities around the world, helping them improve their social, economic and environmental conditions. We actively seek out the needs of the communities with whom we work, and undertake our work on the basis of those needs, employing local labor, using local materials and creating solutions that are appropriate to the region where they are implemented. We work in the areas of economic development, emergency response and transition, health, governance, urban development, infrastructure and housing.</mission><charity_name>CHF International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Robert A.
