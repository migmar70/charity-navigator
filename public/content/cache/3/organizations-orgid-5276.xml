In the past ten years, HDF has worked towards the goals of health and human development in Pakistan. We do this through programs in the areas of community empowerment, education, healthy families, self help infrastructure improvements and economic self-sufficiency. For the past decade, HDF has helped more than 200,000 of the most underprivileged people in all four provinces of Pakistan.</mission><charity_name>Human Development Foundation of North America</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Atiya Khan</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5276</orgid><administration_expenses>192712.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.068000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Schaumburg</city><cob_title>Chairperson</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>60173</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.122000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.750000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.223000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2456554.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.867000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>61.17</financial_score><street_address_1>1350 Remington Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite W</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Fakhia Rashid</current_ceo_name><ein>364184940</ein><total_expenses>2830637.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.064000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1905168.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>181371.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping the most underprivileged people in all four provinces of Pakistan</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.200000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5276/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
