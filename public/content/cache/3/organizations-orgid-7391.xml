WEC is an advocacy organization, meaning we work to influence decisions to make the world a better place. Since our beginning in 1967, WEC has achieved success by bringing people and organizations together with a strong voice for environmental protection in our state. We get results by passing laws that improve people's lives and protect the natural world, getting those laws funded and implemented, engaging the public through organizing, media and communications to build a voice for change, and, when necessary, taking legal action to get environmental laws enforced. Our current campaigns include: climate change, Priorities for a Healthy Washington, Water for Washington, and Local Farms - Healthy Kids, state forests, and electronics recycling.</mission><charity_name>Washington Environmental Council</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Rod Brown</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7391</orgid><administration_expenses>46364.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.037000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Environment</category><city>Seattle</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>98101</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.158000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>61.430000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>WA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Environmental Protection and Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.160000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1013097.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.816000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>63.16</financial_score><street_address_1>1402 Third Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>60.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1400</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Joan Crooks</current_ceo_name><ein>910839385</ein><total_expenses>1240729.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.146000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1626788.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>181268.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Protecting our land, air and water</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.310000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7391/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
