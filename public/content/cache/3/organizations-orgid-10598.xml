Ubuntu's mission is simple, all-encompassing, and radical: to help raise township children by providing what all children deserve- everything. Ubuntu Education Fund was founded on the dream of giving township children the same opportunities to succeed as someone who is born into privilege. We do what it takes to educate and keep each child healthy. We give them the same care that we would give our own children. This includes basic necessities that should be every child's right: health care, a roof over his or her head, someone to talk to, books and pens and school uniforms, nutritious food, and the time to play, imagine, and enjoy being a kid. Ubuntu is transforming our communities.</mission><charity_name>Ubuntu Education Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Andrew Rolfe</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10598</orgid><administration_expenses>275284.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.087000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10004</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.189000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>46.380000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.015000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>2171797.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.693000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>42.54</financial_score><street_address_1>32 Broadway</street_address_1><accountability_score>51.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 414</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jacob Leif</current_ceo_name><ein>311705917</ein><total_expenses>3132654.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.218000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>621434.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>685573.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing world-class health and educational support</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.190000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10598/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
