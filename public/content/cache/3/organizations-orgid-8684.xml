Nashville Area Habitat for Humanity plays an active role in the development and construction of affordable housing units. We collaborate with many other housing providers and community-based agencies. It took 15 years to build the first 100 homes and only four years for the second 100. We built our next 100 in fewer than three years and plan to build our next 100 homes in just over two years. Nashville Area Habitat for Humanity is now in the top one percent of Habitat for Humanity International affiliates worldwide.</mission><charity_name>Nashville Area Habitat for Humanity</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jack King</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8684</orgid><administration_expenses>510855.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.034000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Nashville</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>37203</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.083000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>64.790000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Community and Housing Development</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.117000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>12948606.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.882000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>63.82</financial_score><street_address_1>1006 Eighth Avenue, S</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Danny Herron</current_ceo_name><ein>581636286</ein><total_expenses>14678761.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.083000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>9602234.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1219300.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Building lives, one home, one family, one community at a time</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.650000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8684/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
