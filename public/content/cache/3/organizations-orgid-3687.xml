FEBC's mission is to develop radio programming and deliver it to listeners in Asia in such a way that they move toward Jesus Christ and into His Kingdom, that they know Him as Saviour, Lord, and King, follow His teaching, and live in obedience to Him as His servants, and as members of a local body of believers. FEBC overcomes the barriers of poverty, geography, and persecution to share Christ's love through radio and internet broadcasts.</mission><charity_name>Far East Broadcasting Company</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Douglas Pennoyer</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3687</orgid><administration_expenses>784166.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.083000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>La Mirada</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>90638</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.006000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>56.420000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Media and Broadcasting</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.015000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>7494278.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.794000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>52.12</financial_score><street_address_1>15700 Imperial Highway</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Ed Cannon</current_ceo_name><ein>951461574</ein><total_expenses>9436965.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.122000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>6602278.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1158521.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Christ to the world by radio</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.690000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3687/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
