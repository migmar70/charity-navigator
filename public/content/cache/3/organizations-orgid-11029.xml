It educates the American public about Fonkoze's work in Haiti, facilitates technical assistance for the two Haitian entities, and raises money to support programs, like education. Fonkoze USA also acts as a channel for socially responsible investors who want to invest in Fonkoze's loan fund by lending their money at subsidized interest rates. Fonkoze is Haiti's alternative bank for the organized poor. It is the largest microfinance institution (MFI) in Haiti, serving more than 55,000 women borrowers, most of whom live and work in the countryside of Haiti, and more than 175,000 savers. With its network of 37 branches covering every region of Haiti, it is also the only MFI that is truly national in scope.</mission><charity_name>Fonkoze USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Alex Counts</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11029</orgid><administration_expenses>322906.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.139000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20009</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.111000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>66.030000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.146000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1801722.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.776000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>65.26</financial_score><street_address_1>1700 Kalorama RD NW </street_address_1><accountability_score>67.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 102</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Leigh Carter</current_ceo_name><ein>522022113</ein><total_expenses>2321445.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.084000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1512800.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>196817.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Building the economic foundations for democracy in Haiti</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.600000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11029/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
