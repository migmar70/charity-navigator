Serving as an advocate for young people with the greatest need, the Foundation assists increasing numbers of minority youths through the granting of four-year scholarships for higher education. The JRF provides much more than financial support. While each Jackie Robinson Scholar receives up to $7,500 a year in financial support, they also become an active member in the Foundation's unique Education and Leadership Development Program, which is an extensive mentoring program. JRF Scholars maintain a 97% graduation rate - more than twice the national average for minority students.</mission><charity_name>Jackie Robinson Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Leonard S.
