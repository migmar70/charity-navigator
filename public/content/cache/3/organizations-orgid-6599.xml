In partnership with local agencies, we provide training and seed capital grants to launch or expand a microenterprise and savings support to build assets. We work in 5 countries throughout Africa, Asia and Central America. We also focus our support on women and people with disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Trickle Up believes in people and their capacity to make a difference in their own lives. We empower the world's poorest people to develop their potential and strengthen their communities. We pursue this goal in a way that encourages innovation and leadership, maximizes resources and promotes communication and cooperation among all Trickle Up constituencies. </mission><charity_name>Trickle Up</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Penelope Foley</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6599</orgid><administration_expenses>263469.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.065000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10001</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.005000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>46.360000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.006000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>3148383.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.777000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>36.57</financial_score><street_address_1>104 West 27th Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>12th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>William Abrams</current_ceo_name><ein>061043042</ein><total_expenses>4048008.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.157000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2615979.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>636156.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>The first steps out of poverty</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.420000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6599/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
