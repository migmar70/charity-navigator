Habitat builds and rehabilitates homes in the New Haven area with the goal of creating safe, affordable houses that add to the revitalization of New Haven's neighborhoods. Habitat accomplishes its mission by partnering with individuals, religious and civic organizations, local business and corporations. Habitat of Humanity offers a hand up rather than a handout to families who qualify for the homebuyers program. Approved Habitat families work side-by-side with volunteers from the community to build their house.</mission><charity_name>Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Barbara Katz</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10195</orgid><administration_expenses>106869.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.065000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>New Haven</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>06511</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.279000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.180000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CT</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Community and Housing Development</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.228000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1436931.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.885000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.85</financial_score><street_address_1>37 Union Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>William Casey</current_ceo_name><ein>061178712</ein><total_expenses>1622993.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.048000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1908563.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>79193.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Building neighborhoods . . .one house, one family at a time</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.170000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10195/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
