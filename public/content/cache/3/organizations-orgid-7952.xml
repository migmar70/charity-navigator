Bringing together the most influential people and institutions in government, business and civil society, as well as poor and marginalized communities who are usually left out of the process, we help every part of society work together to create long-term progress. In over 20 years, Synergos has supported innovative global partnerships in more than 30 countries and regions. To promote and support these systems-changing collaborations, our networks help leaders and leading institutions learn from each other and access the ideas, people and resources that can help them make a greater impact in addressing issues of poverty, equity and social justice. In addition, we share the knowledge learned through our work so others can benefit from our experience.</mission><charity_name>Synergos</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Peggy Dulany</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7952</orgid><administration_expenses>1009639.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.131000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10010</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.092000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>54.180000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.067000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>6159847.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.800000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>48.00</financial_score><street_address_1>51 Madison Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>21st Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Robert Dunn</current_ceo_name><ein>133392006</ein><total_expenses>7691153.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.067000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>16369710.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>521667.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Supporting leaders and partnerships to change the systems that keep people in poverty</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.120000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7952/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
