More than 350 infants and children have spent time in an Acres of Love home over the organization's first 10 years of operation. The large majority of these children have been placed in adoptive or long-term foster homes. Some have been reunited with their families. In addition, a significant number of children are established as being HIV-positive and therefore, are still with Acres and unlikely to be adopted. These children require long-term care and likely will remain at Acres throughout their childhood and teenage years.</mission><charity_name>Acres of Love</charity_name><current_ceo_title></current_ceo_title><cob_name>Ryan Audagnotti</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>13171</orgid><administration_expenses>126890.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.073000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>San Juan Capistrano</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>92675</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.066000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>40.710000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.069000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1434601.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.827000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>44.97</financial_score><street_address_1>31920 Del Obispo</street_address_1><accountability_score>37.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 175</street_address_2><current_ceo_name></current_ceo_name><ein>330930465</ein><total_expenses>1733174.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.099000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>138952.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>171683.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing the highest quality of care for abandoned South African children</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.080000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/13171/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
