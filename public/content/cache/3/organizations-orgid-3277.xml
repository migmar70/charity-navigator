As part of a worldwide movement that offers neutral humanitarian care to the victims of war, the American Red Cross distinguishes itself by also aiding victims of devastating natural disasters. Over the years, the organization has expanded its services, always with the aim of preventing and relieving suffering. Today, in addition to domestic disaster relief, the American Red Cross offers compassionate services in five other areas: community services that help the needy; support and comfort for military members and their families; the collection, processing and distribution of lifesaving blood and blood products; educational programs that promote health and safety; and international relief and development programs.</mission><charity_name>American Red Cross</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Bonnie McElveen-Hunter</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3277</orgid><administration_expenses>137509155.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.040000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board                             </cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20006</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.031000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.640000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Multipurpose Human Service Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.014000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3157481991.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.922000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.35</financial_score><street_address_1>2025 E Street, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Gail McGovern</current_ceo_name><ein>530196605</ein><total_expenses>3422010386.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.037000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2191924285.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>127019240.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping people prevent, prepare for and respond to emergencies</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.440000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3277/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
