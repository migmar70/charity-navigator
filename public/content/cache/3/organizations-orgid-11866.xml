Our mission is to equip people living in extreme poverty with the resources to create sustainable businesses. Village Enterprise plays a unique role in the poverty reduction and microenterprise development fields, focusing on the rural poor and providing those who do not have an income with all of the tools they need to start an income-generating business. Our program builds successful, long-lasting, small businesses with a complete package of support: Business Training &amp; On-going Business Mentoring, Start-Up Grants, and Business Savings Programs. 23,000 small businesses launched with Village Enterprise's help and 88% of businesses continue beyond 1 year, and 75% still going after 4 years.</mission><charity_name>Village Enterprise Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Larry Langdon</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11866</orgid><administration_expenses>81320.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.073000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>San Carlos</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94070</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.022000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>42.050000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>0</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.026000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>862717.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.776000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>37.86</financial_score><street_address_1>751 Laurel Street, PMB 222</street_address_1><accountability_score>47.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Dianne Calvi</current_ceo_name><ein>222852248</ein><total_expenses>1111590.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.150000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>175988.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>167553.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Creating sustainable businesses.
