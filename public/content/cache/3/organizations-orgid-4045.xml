March of Dimes has saved the lives of millions of babies since our founding. And we won't stop until we reach the day when every baby is born healthy. The mission of the March of Dimes is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects and infant mortality. We carry out this mission through research, community services, education and advocacy to save babies' lives. March of Dimes researchers, volunteers, educators, outreach workers and advocates work together to give all babies a fighting chance against the threats to their health: prematurity, birth defects, and low birthweight.</mission><charity_name>March of Dimes</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>LaVerne H.
