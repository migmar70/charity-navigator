We provide small loans, business training and community development programs through a network of locally-led organizations in twelve countries to equip poor families to improve their lives. After more than two decades of work across the developing world, endPoverty.org understands that poor people in every country have skills and initiative that they want to use to lift their families out of poverty. Instead of a handout in the form of aid, many thousands of poor clients have received a hand up through training and small business loans.</mission><charity_name>endPoverty.org</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Larry Roadman</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5494</orgid><administration_expenses>109367.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.164000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Bethesda</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20814</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.145000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>41.390000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.131000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>435130.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.653000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>31.07</financial_score><street_address_1>7910 Woodmont Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1120</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Kenneth Wesche</current_ceo_name><ein>541371549</ein><total_expenses>665404.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.181000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>232834.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>120907.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Transforming lives through microenterprise</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.340000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5494/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
