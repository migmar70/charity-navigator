Through a combination of advocacy, education, and partnerships with grassroots organizations, UUSC promotes economic rights, advances environmental justice, defends civil liberties, and preserves the rights of people in times of humanitarian crisis. We also engage local communities through experiential-learning programs which introduce participants to the work of our domestic and overseas partners -- who are often on the front lines of addressing social-justice issues. Our work is built on the conviction that all people are entitled to basic human rights, which transcend divisions of class, race, nationality, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, and gender.</mission><charity_name>Unitarian Universalist Service Committee</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Chuck Spence</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4599</orgid><administration_expenses>253676.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.041000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Cambridge</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>02139</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.039000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>55.290000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.031000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>5325243.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.865000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>49.21</financial_score><street_address_1>689 Massachusetts Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>William F.
