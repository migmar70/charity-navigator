We enhance the quality of life for the people of Alameda and Contra Costa counties through grant making, community-building initiatives, and research. We deepen philanthropy by providing an array of expert services to those who hold charitable funds with us and by focusing on advancing economic opportunity for adults and families in need and on ensuring very young children are successful in the education system so they have economic opportunity when they become adults. Last year we granted $47.67 million to nonprofit organizations. Our charitable assets under management total more than $331 million.</mission><charity_name>East Bay Community Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Deborah Alvarez-Rodriguez</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3640</orgid><administration_expenses>2633270.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.042000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Oakland</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94612    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.168000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>58.970000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Community Foundations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.119000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>59033577.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.941000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>54.41</financial_score><street_address_1>200 Frank Ogawa Plaza</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Nicole Taylor</current_ceo_name><ein>946070996</ein><total_expenses>62668990.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.015000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>234060332.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1002143.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Where leadership and the power of effective giving come together</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.910000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3640/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
