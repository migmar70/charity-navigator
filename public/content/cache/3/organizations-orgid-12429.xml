Upon showing this documentary in the United States, the story of the child soldiers sparked a youth-oriented grassroots movement driven by the desire to transform apathy into activism.This movement led to the establishment of Invisible Children, Inc. as a registered 501(c)3 in 2005. IC's programs include educational and microeconomic initiatives in Central Africa benefitting over 11,000 people as well as biannual tours, awareness events, and fundraising campaigns stateside. Recently, IC has expanded its operations to Central Africa to address the plight of the most recent victims of the LRA's reign of terror who live in some of the most remote regions of the world. </mission><charity_name>Invisible Children</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12429</orgid><administration_expenses>1444570.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.162000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>San Diego</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>92101</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.233000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.530000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.063000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>7163384.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.805000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>62.39</financial_score><street_address_1>1620 Fifth Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>48.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 400</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Ben Keesey</current_ceo_name><ein>542164338</ein><total_expenses>8894632.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.032000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>6584811.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>286678.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Using the power of stories to change lives around the world</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.740000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12429/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
