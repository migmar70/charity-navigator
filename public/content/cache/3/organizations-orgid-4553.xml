Since its creation in 1917, The Rotary Foundation has grown into a global force for good, thanks to the generosity of Rotarians and friends of Rotary who share our vision for a better world. Rotary is a worldwide organization of more than 1.2 million business, professional, and community leaders. Members of Rotary clubs, known as Rotarians, provide humanitarian service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. Rotary's main objective is service - in the community, in the workplace, and throughout the world.</mission><charity_name>The Rotary Foundation of Rotary International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>General Manager</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Sakuji Tanaka &#xD;
