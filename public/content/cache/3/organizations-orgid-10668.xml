SHNS is dedicated to providing quality, low-cost private education to at-risk youth in the 6th through 8th grades. It is an academically challenging and a highly structured environment. These youth, 96% Latino, are in danger of dropping out of school and risking a lifetime of poor outcomes. At SHNS our students benefit from a rich and integrated environment where they learn not only reading, math and science, but also the importance of hard work, ethical leadership, compassion for others and responsible citizenship.</mission><charity_name>Sacred Heart Nativity School</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mike Sheridan</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10668</orgid><administration_expenses>459147.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.189000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Education</category><city>San Jose</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>95110</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.007000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.870000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Private Elementary and Secondary Schools</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.035000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1857574.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.765000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>50.02</financial_score><street_address_1>310 Edwards Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Peter Pabst, SJ</current_ceo_name><ein>952206754</ein><total_expenses>2427639.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.045000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>6984127.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>110918.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Breaking the cycle of poverty through education in the service of faith and the promotion of justice</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.770000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10668/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
