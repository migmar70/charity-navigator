We distribute wheelchairs worldwide through a network NGO's that have ongoing humanitarian relief missions in the countries of wheelchair destination. These distribution partners handle all aspects of the importation and distribution of the wheelchairs to children that can now go to school, adults that can now go to work and seniors that can once again become an active part of family life and society. A total of 749,138 wheelchairs have been committed or delivered in 153 countries and geographical areas.</mission><charity_name>Wheelchair Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Kenneth E.
