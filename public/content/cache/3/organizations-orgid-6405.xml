As the nation's leading nonprofit medical flight organization it is Miracle Flights for Kids' goal to remove barriers to healthcare access and improve the quality of life for our nation's children. MFFK works hard to forge the necessary alliances with commercial airlines and sponsors that provide us the means to fly children to and from treatment - as many times as needed. Since 1985, MFFK has coordinated over 50,000 flights.</mission><charity_name>Miracle Flights for Kids</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Larry Scheffler</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6405</orgid><administration_expenses>179582.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.077000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Green Valley</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board                             </cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>89014</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.101000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>33.720000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NV</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Patient and Family Support</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.043000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>1346930.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.577000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>25.77</financial_score><street_address_1>2764 North Green Valley Parkway</street_address_1><accountability_score>44.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 115</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Ann McGee</current_ceo_name><ein>880209952</ein><total_expenses>2331299.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.345000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1302742.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>804787.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>We're flying for your life</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.550000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6405/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
