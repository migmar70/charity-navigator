We are building a more sustainable future through the power of professional design. By tapping a network of more than 40,000 professionals willing to lend time and expertise to help those who would not otherwise be able to afford their services, we bring design, construction and development services where they are most critically needed. Each year 10,000 people directly benefit from structures designed by Architecture for Humanity. Our advocacy, training and outreach programs impact an additional 50,000 people annually. We channel the resources of the global funding community to meaningful projects that make a difference locally. Our clients include community groups, aid organizations, housing developers, government agencies, corporate divisions, and foundations.</mission><charity_name>Architecture for Humanity</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Niama Jacobs</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11671</orgid><administration_expenses>450430.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.095000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>San Francisco</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94107</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.654000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.670000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Community and Housing Development</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.516000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>3985113.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.849000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>65.99</financial_score><street_address_1>848 Folsom</street_address_1><accountability_score>62.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 201</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Cameron Sinclair</current_ceo_name><ein>300038297</ein><total_expenses>4693053.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.054000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2964008.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>257510.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>It's time to do more</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.630000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11671/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
