Several Sources also operates a day time shelter for homeless women in Newark, NJ called Ladies Rest. Furthermore, Several Sources has developed an interactive CD-ROM called the Choice Game. The purpose of the game is to teach the values of life, chastity, and sound decision making to youth so that they can see the consequences of their future actions. Accordingly, Several Sources is very active with the internet and maintains numerous websites that feature the work of the organization, allowing it to expand counseling and educational efforts throughout the United States.</mission><charity_name>Several Sources Shelters</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11752</orgid><administration_expenses>306176.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.148000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Ramsey</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>0</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>07446</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.005000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.170000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NJ</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Children's and Family Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.164000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1537028.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.743000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>51.36</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
