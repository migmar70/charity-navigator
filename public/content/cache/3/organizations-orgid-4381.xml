Since its beginning in 1986, RTC has supported the tremendous growth and development of rail-trails. Today, there are more than 1,500 preserved pathways that form the backbone of a growing trail system that spans communities, regions, states and, indeed, the entire country. We remain dedicated to the creation of a nationwide network of trails. Further, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is committed to enhancing the health of America's environment, transportation, economy, neighborhoods and people - ensuring a better future made possible by trails and the connections they inspire.</mission><charity_name>Rails-To-Trails Conservancy</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Charles N.
