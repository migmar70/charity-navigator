We work with partners and influence decision-makers to maximize our impact. WaterAid enables the world's poorest people to gain access to safe water and sanitation. Together with improved hygiene, these basic human rights underpin health, education and livelihoods, forming the first essential step in overcoming poverty. We work with local partners, who understand local issues, and provide them with the skills and support to help communities set up and manage practical and sustainable projects that meet their real needs. We also work locally and internationally to change policy and practice and ensure that water, hygiene and sanitation's vital role in reducing poverty is recognized.</mission><charity_name>WaterAid America</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Rachel Brydon Jannetta</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12760</orgid><administration_expenses>517541.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.141000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10017</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.118000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>47.250000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.031000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>2852206.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.779000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>37.84</financial_score><street_address_1>315 Madison Ave</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 2301</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>David Winder</current_ceo_name><ein>300181674</ein><total_expenses>3657633.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.078000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1373829.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>287886.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>The leading charity for clean, safe water and sanitation in Africa and Asia</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.370000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12760/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
