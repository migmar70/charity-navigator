Working with partners across Africa, Asia and the Pacific for nearly a decade, we currently have partnerships in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, China and the United States.</mission><charity_name>Pangaea Global AIDS Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Eric Roberts</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11664</orgid><administration_expenses>936408.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.259000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Oakland</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94607</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.036000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>54.580000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.183000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>2581729.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.715000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>48.57</financial_score><street_address_1>472 Ninth Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Benedict Plumley</current_ceo_name><ein>912167423</ein><total_expenses>3607877.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.024000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>348626.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>89740.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Advancing the health and well-being of people most affected by AIDS</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.090000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11664/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
