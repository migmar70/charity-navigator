The refuge is open to the citizens of Colorado and other visitors for a minimum of eight hours per day, seven days per week (except major holidays). The sanctuary is in operation 24 hours a day, run by staff and volunteers. The Wild Animal Sanctuary is one of only 14 true sanctuaries for abused and abandoned great cats and bears in the United States, where the animals are not bred, sold, or otherwise commercially exploited in any way. The Sanctuary is located on rural, rolling grasslands northeast of the Denver Metro area. Comprising 720 acres and sheltering more than 290 lions, tigers, bears, leopards, mountain lions, wolves and other large carnivores, it is the first sanctuary of its kind to create large acreage species-specific habitats for its rescued animals.</mission><charity_name>The Wild Animal Sanctuary</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Founder and Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Judy Wilson</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11343</orgid><administration_expenses>115274.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.039000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Keenesburg</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>80643</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.336000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>66.230000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CO</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Wildlife Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.313000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2621375.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.898000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>66.48</financial_score><street_address_1>1946 County Road 53</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Pat Craig</current_ceo_name><ein>841351483</ein><total_expenses>2916797.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.061000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2568365.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>180148.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Saving One Animal May Not Change The World...&#xD;
