Their goal was to protect Oregon's quality of life from the effects of uncontrolled growth. Today, 1000 Friends staff focus on education and advocacy, to engage Oregonians in a fresh conversation about Oregon's future, and how to make sure it's a future we all want. We seek to enhance the quality of life we enjoy in Oregon, with beautiful natural areas, the family-owned farms and woodlots that comprise our working landscapes, and vibrant, livable communities for urban and rural residents alike.</mission><charity_name>1000 Friends of Oregon</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Charlie Swindells</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8770</orgid><administration_expenses>155945.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.149000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Environment</category><city>Portland</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>2</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>97204</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.119000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>42.050000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>OR</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Environmental Protection and Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.114000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>732207.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.701000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>34.33</financial_score><street_address_1>534 Southwest Third Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>53.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 300</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jason Miner</current_ceo_name><ein>930642086</ein><total_expenses>1044311.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.149000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>237188.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>156159.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Working with Oregonians to enhance our quality of life</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.090000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8770/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
