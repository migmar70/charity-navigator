Its initial purpose was to stem the brain drain of Israeli researchers by providing funds for postdoctoral fellowships for young Ph.D.'s. ICRF is the only U.S.-based charity solely devoted to supporting cancer research in Israel. Since its inception, ICRF has provided more than $33 million to support innovative studies by Israeli scientists. Our awardees are selected through a rigorous peer-review process that is conducted by a world-class scientific panel. We support individuals at all of the major research institutions in Israel.</mission><charity_name>Israel Cancer Research Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Bradley Goldhar</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5921</orgid><administration_expenses>969553.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.403000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10017</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.025000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>37.080000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Medical Research</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.148000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>844956.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.351000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>25.93</financial_score><street_address_1>295 Madison Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>55.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1030</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Eric Heffler</current_ceo_name><ein>510181215</ein><total_expenses>2401488.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.244000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>7779196.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>586979.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Supporting cancer research in Israel</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.640000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5921/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
