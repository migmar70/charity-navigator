HFHLC builds partnerships with diverse members of the community which break down the walls that divide and builds a sense of community among all people. HFHLC seeks to make safe, simple, decent housing for all people a matter of conscience and action. &#xD;
&#xD;
HFHLC was established in 1989 to provide affordable homes that lower income families can own. Homeowner families are selected according to their need, their ability to repay the no-profit, no-interest mortgage, and their partnership to contribute 500 hours of sweat equity.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Habitat ReStore accepts and then sells new and used building materials and household goods further supporting affordable housing, while keeping tons of material from the landfill. It is at 3545 Grand Avenue in Gurnee.</mission><charity_name>Habitat for Humanity Lake County, IL</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Todd Sheton</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11168</orgid><administration_expenses>145365.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.086000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Waukegan</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>60085</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.044000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.240000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Community and Housing Development</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.032000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1473957.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.881000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.44</financial_score><street_address_1>315 North Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Julie Donovan</current_ceo_name><ein>363659288</ein><total_expenses>1672398.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.031000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>4150445.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>53076.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Building Homes, Building Community, Building Lives</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.480000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11168/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
