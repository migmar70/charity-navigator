Food, being the best medicine, gives kids their best shot at developing fully and well into young adults, and education is the foundation of a productive life in today's world. Children of the Americas, made up mostly of volunteers, feeds breakfast to over 500 children six days a week in Tijuana, Mexico through five nutrition programs. School supplies in the form of Rainbow Backpacks (containing enough school supplies for one child for one year) are also given to up to 700 children every year. We also provide computers and other educational equipment.</mission><charity_name>Children of The Americas</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Dave Brisbin</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6370</orgid><administration_expenses>17745.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.017000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Trabuco Canyon</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>92679</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0E-15</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.190000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.006000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>987192.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.965000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>48.94</financial_score><street_address_1>67 Gingham Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>David Brisbin</current_ceo_name><ein>770018357</ein><total_expenses>1022680.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.017000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>10937.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>17743.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Over 30 years of loving children ... one child at a time</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.010000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6370/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
