HCZ has experienced incredible growth - from the number of children we serve to the breadth of our services. But one thing has stayed the same: the agency's whatever it takes attitude when it comes to helping children to succeed. Today, HCZ continues to offer innovative, efficiently run programs that are aimed at doing nothing less than breaking the cycle of generational poverty for the thousands of children and families it serves. All HCZ programs are offered free to the children and families of Harlem.</mission><charity_name>Harlem Children's Zone</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Stan Druckenmiller</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4398</orgid><administration_expenses>3653365.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.046000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10035</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.501000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>67.820000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Children's and Family Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.212000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>73133116.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.932000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>69.32</financial_score><street_address_1>35 East 125th Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>67.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Geoffery Canada</current_ceo_name><ein>237112974</ein><total_expenses>78446544.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.021000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>316754014.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1660063.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Offering education, social-service and community-building programs to children and families</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>4.030000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4398/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
