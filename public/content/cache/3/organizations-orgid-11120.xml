In partnership with the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the U. S. Government, Canvasback operates a Diabetes Wellness Center on Majuro Atoll. Canvasback also partners with the Governments of Micronesia to send specialty surgery and dental teams to their small State Hospitals. The objectives of these teams of volunteers are to provide healing surgeries for islanders who might otherwise not receive care and to empower the local health care providers. Canvasback has programs to involve American youth in service to the islanders. We are a Christian organization with an emphasis on demonstrating, rather than preaching the love of God.</mission><charity_name>Canvasback Missions, Inc.</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Co-Founder, President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>William Maclean</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11120</orgid><administration_expenses>78836.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.071000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Benicia</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>0</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94510</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.023000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>47.950000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.033000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>991176.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.893000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.08</financial_score><street_address_1>940 Adams Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>50.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite R</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jamie Spence</current_ceo_name><ein>930831904</ein><total_expenses>1108857.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.035000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>437480.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>38844.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Serving the forgotten island people of Micronesia since 1981</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.390000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11120/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
