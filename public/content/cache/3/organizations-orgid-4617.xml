The oldest of 37 national committees for UNICEF worldwide, we are part of a global effort to save, protect and improve children's lives. Every moment of every day, UNICEF is on the ground providing lifesaving help for children in need. We provide families with clean water and sanitation, we vaccinate against childhood illness, and we help protect children against malaria. We provide nourishment to fight malnutrition, and we care for children affected by AIDS. We protect children from abuse, and we give them an education. We are here to make sure that all children lead a healthy, humane, and dignified life.</mission><charity_name>United States Fund for UNICEF</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Anthony Pantaleoni</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4617</orgid><administration_expenses>12872481.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.028000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10038</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.060000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.670000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.056000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>404828573.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.905000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>57.19</financial_score><street_address_1>125 Maiden Lane</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Caryl Stern</current_ceo_name><ein>131760110</ein><total_expenses>446925075.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.065000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>54082998.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>29224021.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Doing whatever it takes to save a child</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.110000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4617/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
