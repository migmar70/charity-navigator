With public debate around important issues often dominated by special interests pursuing their own narrow agendas, U.S. PIRG Education Fund offers an independent voice that works on behalf of the public interest. The Education Fund works to protect consumers and promote good government. We investigate problems, craft solutions, educate the public, and offer Americans meaningful opportunities for civic participation. Our focus areas include clean air/water, global warming and energy, preservation, conservation, toxic pollution, and consumer education and government reform.</mission><charity_name>U.S. PIRG Education Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Douglas Phelps</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5433</orgid><administration_expenses>89328.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.043000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Boston</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>02108</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.064000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>43.380000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Advocacy and Civil Rights</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.031000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1882756.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.914000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>63.07</financial_score><street_address_1>44 Winter Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>33.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>4th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Andre Delattre</current_ceo_name><ein>521384240</ein><total_expenses>2058249.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.041000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>6954244.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>86165.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>An independent voice working on behalf of the public interest</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>3.370000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5433/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
