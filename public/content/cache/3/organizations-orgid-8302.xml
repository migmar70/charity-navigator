Since 1947, the Foundation has funded over 200 research projects designed to discover the causes of traffic crashes, prevent them, and minimize injuries when they do occur. We have used this research to develop dozens of focused, high-impact educational materials for drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists and other road users. Government agencies and legislators--as well as automobile clubs, driving schools, and school districts--turn to the Foundation's research to guide them in creating policies that can save lives on our roads and highways, teach adults how to drive more responsibly, and teach children about vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian safety.</mission><charity_name>AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Paul C.
