Our mission is to support the building of civil society in Pakistan by providing quality education to underprivileged children, promoting gender equality and advocating for reform of public education.  We believe that education is a basic human right, a pre-requisite for democratic institutions to flourish in Pakistan and for its people to compete in a global economy. TCF currently has 730 schools in all four provinces of Pakistan with 102,000 children enrolled - half of them girls. </mission><charity_name>The Citizens Foundation, USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Zarrar Sehgal</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12225</orgid><administration_expenses>303542.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.076000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Schaumburg</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>60173</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.163000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>65.880000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.207000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>3638443.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.918000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>64.18</financial_score><street_address_1>1350 Remington Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite A</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Danial Noorani</current_ceo_name><ein>412046295</ein><total_expenses>3963270.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.005000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>3041579.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>21285.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>We can change their lives and they will change the world</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.480000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12225/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
