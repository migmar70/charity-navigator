World Neighbors invests in people and their communities by training and inspiring them to create their own life-changing solutions through programs in agriculture, literacy, water, health and environmental protection. Since 1951, more than 25 million people in 45 countries have transformed their lives with the support of World Neighbors. Our programs focus on hunger, poverty, disease and the environment. Communities tell World Neighbors what their needs are, and World Neighbors, in turn, works with them to acquire the knowledge, skills and organization to solve their problems.</mission><charity_name>World Neighbors</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>David Bearden</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4764</orgid><administration_expenses>634710.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.131000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Oklahoma City</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>73120    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.043000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.320000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>OK</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.241000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3370517.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.697000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.42</financial_score><street_address_1>4127 Northwest 122nd Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Melanie Macdonald</current_ceo_name><ein>730707328</ein><total_expenses>4829871.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.170000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>9441326.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>824644.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Inspiring people.
