In 1988, the food bank became a certified member of Feeding America, the nation's food bank network. Since its founding, the food bank has distributed more than 100 million pounds of food to charitable feeding organizations across the 24 counties it serves. In addition to food distribution services and disaster relief, the food bank also operates numerous feeding programs for low income children and seniors. Since the first child nutrition program started in January 2003, these programs have continued to expand and now include over 50 afterschool snack and summer lunch sites, which support over 4,000 children. Our Senior Nutrition Program has grown from serving 100 monthly to serving 320 homebound seniors in Mobile County. </mission><charity_name>Bay Area Food Bank</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Alexis Atkins</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7263</orgid><administration_expenses>444480.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.014000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Theodore</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>36582</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.168000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.830000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>AL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.200000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>30603124.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.976000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>69.76</financial_score><street_address_1>5248 Mobile South Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>David Reaney</current_ceo_name><ein>630821997</ein><total_expenses>31329102.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.008000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>8256304.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>281498.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Serving the Central Gulf Coast</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.260000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7263/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
