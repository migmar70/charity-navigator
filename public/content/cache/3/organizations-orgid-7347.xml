A group of concerned citizens, working with the National Park Service, started the Foundation in order to protect, preserve, and enhance Yellowstone National Park.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Foundation works to fund important projects and programs, many of which are beyond the financial capacity of the National Park Service. The Foundation receives no annual government funding; it relies instead upon the generous support of private citizens, foundations, and corporations to ensure that Yellowstone's great gifts to the world will never diminish.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since its inception, the Yellowstone Park Foundation has contributed more than $40 million to Yellowstone National Park, and has successfully funded more than 200 Park projects. Including $15 million for the new Old Faithful Visitor Education Center.</mission><charity_name>Yellowstone Park Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Kay Yeager</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7347</orgid><administration_expenses>434609.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.094000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Bozeman</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>59715</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.017000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.580000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MT</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Fundraising Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.046000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3587990.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.783000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.27</financial_score><street_address_1>222 East Main Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 301</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Karen Bates Kress</current_ceo_name><ein>830311166</ein><total_expenses>4579174.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.121000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>11739089.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>556575.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Protecting the wonders and wildlife of Yellowstone</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.560000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7347/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
