Our goal is to end the book famine in Africa. Books donated by publishers, schools, libraries, individuals, and organizations are sorted and packed by volunteers who carefully choose books that are age and subject appropriate. We send good books, enough books for a whole class to use. Since 1988, Books For Africa has shipped more than 20 million books to 45 African countries. They are on once-empty library shelves, in classrooms in rural schools, and in the hands of children who have never before held a book. Each book will be read over and over again. When the books arrive, they go to those who need them most: children who are hungry to read, hungry to learn, hungry to explore the world in ways that only books make possible.</mission><charity_name>Books For Africa</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Norm Linnell</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3373</orgid><administration_expenses>76108.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.003000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>St. Paul</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>55101    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.025000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.260000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.026000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>23452680.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.990000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.47</financial_score><street_address_1>253 East Fourth Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 200</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Patrick Plonski</current_ceo_name><ein>411627391</ein><total_expenses>23675701.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.006000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>4592493.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>146913.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Working to end the book famine in Africa</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.190000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3373/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
