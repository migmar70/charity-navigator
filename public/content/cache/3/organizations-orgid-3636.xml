Brower, Earth Island Institute is a public interest membership organization that supports people who are creating solutions to protect our shared planet. Since its founding, Earth Island Institute has been a hub for grassroots campaigns dedicated to conserving, preserving, and restoring the ecosystems on which our civilization depends. Our Project Support program acts as an incubator for start-up environmental projects, giving crucial assistance to groups and individuals with new ideas for promoting ecological sustainability. We also inform and inspire people to take action through our award-winning quarterly magazine, Earth Island Journal. We act as an umbrella organization, providing individual projects with the freedom to develop new initiatives by offering a wide range of professional services.</mission><charity_name>Earth Island Institute</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Martha Davis</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3636</orgid><administration_expenses>1157577.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.115000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Environment</category><city>Berkeley</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94704</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.035000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>61.070000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Environmental Protection and Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.060000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>8132832.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.809000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.23</financial_score><street_address_1>2150 Allston Way</street_address_1><accountability_score>62.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 460</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Dave Phillips</current_ceo_name><ein>942889684</ein><total_expenses>10052526.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.075000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>7136011.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>762117.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>You are here</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.700000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3636/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
