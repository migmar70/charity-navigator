In addition, we strive to support and encourage those afflicted and their families as they struggle to endure, adjust and cope with the demands of these fatal illnesses. Accordingly, our mission is four-fold: to broaden public awareness of Krabbe Disease and other Leukodystrophies; to gather and provide current, functional information and service linkages to families of children with Leukodystrophies; to fund research efforts that will identify new treatments, therapies and ultimately, a cure for Krabbe Disease and other Leukodystrophies; and to establish an alliance of hope that will nourish, affirm and confront the urgent need for medical, financial and emotional support.</mission><charity_name>Hunter's Hope Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jill Kelly</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9823</orgid><administration_expenses>127745.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.129000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Orchard Park</city><cob_title>Chairwoman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>14127</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.082000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>52.600000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>0</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Diseases, Disorders, and Disciplines</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.016000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>769898.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.777000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>47.99</financial_score><street_address_1>6368 West Quaker Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>P.O.
