Touch has trained hundreds of healthcare workers such as doctors, nurses, lab technicians and pharmacists. Now, Touch is working to ensure these healthcare professionals are treating the patients where the greatest needs exist. The Touch Foundation was created as a secular, nonprofit organization in 2004 to further the work of Father Dr. Peter Le Jacq and friends who had formed the Touching Tanzania committee in the 1980s. Although the scope of our programs has expanded, the underlying principles remain - to train more doctors and improve healthcare provision in sub-Saharan Africa.</mission><charity_name>Touch Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title></current_ceo_title><cob_name>Lowell Bryan</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>13173</orgid><administration_expenses>529272.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.185000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10022</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.146000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>35.280000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.278000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>1876775.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.657000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>28.35</financial_score><street_address_1>875 Third Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>44.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>5th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name></current_ceo_name><ein>201469976</ein><total_expenses>2854800.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.157000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>868271.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>448753.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Saving lives in rural Africa</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.300000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/13173/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
