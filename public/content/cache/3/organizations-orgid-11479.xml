Since 1993, Camfed has improved the learning environment of over 1.9 million children in rural areas of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana and Malawi and has trained over 17,671 Camfed alumnae to advocate for and lead change in their communities. All Camfed programs begin with an individual girl. By looking at the world from the individual girl's perspective, Camfed works to dismantle the hurdles in her way to obtaining an education and living a healthy adult life. Camfed achieves this by partnering with community members at all levels who help lead Camfed's program design and implementation. Camfed enables communities to solve problems, identify their own resources, knowledge and creativity, and supports them in creating an environment in which every girl is educated, protected, respected, and valued, and grows up to turn the tide of poverty.</mission><charity_name>Camfed USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Dhiren Shah</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11479</orgid><administration_expenses>140740.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.029000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>San Francisco</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94104</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.400000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>67.500000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.646000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>4296836.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.897000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>66.47</financial_score><street_address_1>465 California Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 626</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Brooke Hutchinson</current_ceo_name><ein>542033897</ein><total_expenses>4790125.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.073000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>3308315.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>352549.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>When you educate a girl everything changes</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.690000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11479/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
