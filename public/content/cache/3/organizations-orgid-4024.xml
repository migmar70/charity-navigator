Natural outdoor exhibits for more than 2,000 animals from Florida and similar habitats include a Florida wildlife center and manatee hospital, Asian Gardens, Primate World, Free-Flight Aviaries, Wallaroo Station children's zoo, and Safari Africa. The Florida Environmental Education Center (The Zoo School) serves more than 147,000 children annually. Programs offered are summer and holiday camps, daycare, preschool, and kindergarten. Re-opened at its current site in 1988, Lowry Park Zoo is today the number-one family-friendly zoo in the U.S. and recognized by the State of Florida as a center for Florida wildlife conservation and biodiversity.</mission><charity_name>Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Catherine Lowry Straz</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4024</orgid><administration_expenses>1975401.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.129000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Tampa</city><cob_title>Chairperson</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>33604    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.001000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>54.680000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>FL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Zoos and Aquariums</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.018000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>12850694.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.842000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>53.47</financial_score><street_address_1>1101 West Sligh Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>56.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Craig Pugh</current_ceo_name><ein>592328289</ein><total_expenses>15249665.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.027000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>34698474.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>423570.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Offering enjoyment for everyone</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.230000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4024/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
