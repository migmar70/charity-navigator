&#xD;
During the last 12 years, PCA has impacted more than 4 million youth through partnerships with more than 1,700 youth sports organizations, leagues, schools and cities nationwide. PCA has presented over 9,000 workshops, training more than 430,000 coaches, parents, organization leaders and athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
PCA's Double-Goal Coach&#xC2;&#xAE; curriculum helps coaches adapt the model that the first goal is winning and the second, more important goal is teaching life lessons through sports. PCA material for Second-Goal Parents&#xE2;&#x84;&#xA2; trains parents to focus on children's life lessons and not the scoreboard. PCA's Triple-Impact Competitor&#xE2;&#x84;&#xA2; program develops youth who are committed to improving themselves, their teammates and their sport as a whole.</mission><charity_name>Positive Coaching Alliance</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Gary Petersmeyer</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10563</orgid><administration_expenses>565466.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.126000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Mountain View</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>0</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94043</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.096000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>43.310000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Multipurpose Human Service Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.035000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>3113477.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.694000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>47.11</financial_score><street_address_1>1001 North Rengstorff Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>40.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 100</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jim Thompson</current_ceo_name><ein>770485946</ein><total_expenses>4481818.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.179000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1665536.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>802875.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Transforming youth sports so sports can transform youth</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.370000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10563/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
