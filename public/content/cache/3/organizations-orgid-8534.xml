We are available to help you connect to the Jewish roots of your faith; to provide speakers for events in your area; to travel to Israel as students or volunteers; to tell Israel's story to the media, the government, churches and civic groups; and to stand with millions of Christians around the world in support of the land and the people God has chosen for His own. BFP also offers assistance to Jewish immigrants and other poor people in Israel by providing food baskets, blankets and medical assistance.</mission><charity_name>Bridges For Peace</charity_name><current_ceo_title>National Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Rev.
