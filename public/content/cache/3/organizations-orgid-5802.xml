The Foundation was established in 1976 and is best known for its groundbreaking work with two western lowland gorillas, Koko and Michael, who were taught to become fluent in American Sign Language. Our current goals include: establishing the Maui Ape Preserve; helping Koko to have a baby, with her new mate, Ndume, and thus foster cultural transmission of a human-taught language to a new generation of gorillas; providing and modeling the best care for gorillas in captivity; and developing multimedia and web-based educational resources for partner institutions, schools and advocates.</mission><charity_name>The Gorilla Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Penny Patterson</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5802</orgid><administration_expenses>113858.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.074000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Woodside</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94062</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.156000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>45.670000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Wildlife Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.026000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1131736.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.740000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>37.40</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
