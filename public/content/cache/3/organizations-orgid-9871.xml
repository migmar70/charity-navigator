The school enrolls 950 students in pre-first through twelfth grades. The student-teacher ratio is 10:1 and class sizes average 15 students. In our close environment, students know they have support from their teachers and friends. They learn to ask questions, think critically and communicate well. Because we are small, student/faculty/parent partnerships come easier. Our family-centered environment develops academically, culturally, socially, athletically and emotionally strong students. We have championship teams, acclaimed fine arts programs, an award-winning service program and a drama program second to none.</mission><charity_name>Pace Academy</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Head of School</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Timothy J.Walsh</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9871</orgid><administration_expenses>3730242.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.154000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Education</category><city>Atlanta</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>30327</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.039000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.860000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>GA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Private Elementary and Secondary Schools</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.061000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>19441564.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.807000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>57.50</financial_score><street_address_1>966 West Paces Ferry Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Fred Assaf</current_ceo_name><ein>580706812</ein><total_expenses>24072731.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.037000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>77794315.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>900925.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Start small.
