Its mission is to empower children who are at risk of incarceration to maximize their potential by providing them with academic, social and values enrichment though supportive mentoring and the use of technology. Through our innovative afterschool and mentoring program, currently operating in ten cities nationwide, we are transforming children into dreamers who envision and realize their potential. Our research-based programs challenge more than 1,000 young people and engage them in active learning through one-on-one mentoring, strong academics, and technology-driven activities and curricula.</mission><charity_name>U.S. Dream Academy</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Founder, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jody Victor</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9918</orgid><administration_expenses>387178.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.098000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Columbia</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>21044</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0E-15</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.580000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Children's and Family Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.199000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3067596.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.780000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>52.28</financial_score><street_address_1>5950 Symphony Woods Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>55.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 504</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Wintley Phipps</current_ceo_name><ein>593514841</ein><total_expenses>3932630.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.121000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1943350.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>477856.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>A child with a dream is a child with a future</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.490000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9918/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
