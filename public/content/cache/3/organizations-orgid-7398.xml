The mission of Zion Preparatory Academy is to ensure academic excellence in a loving, supportive environment where every child receives individual attention and instruction. Zion Prep espouses a simple philosophy: every child is somebody to be loved, to be taught, and to be valued as a unique individual. Zion Prep's approach includes a preschool program for one-year olds through pre-kindergartners, an academic program for children in kindergarten through eighth grade, and before and after school day care. The school has grown to assist 400 children annually, from toddlers to eighth graders.</mission><charity_name>Zion Preparatory Academy</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Head of School</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Donigan, Heyward</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7398</orgid><administration_expenses>1274228.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.317000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Education</category><city>Seattle</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>98118</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.055000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>33.520000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>WA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Private Elementary and Secondary Schools</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.016000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>2531168.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.630000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>25.44</financial_score><street_address_1>4730 32nd Avenue, S</street_address_1><accountability_score>44.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Doug Wheeler</current_ceo_name><ein>911556746</ein><total_expenses>4013155.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.051000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>4674716.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>207759.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Developing tomorrow's leaders, one child at a time</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.630000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7398/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
