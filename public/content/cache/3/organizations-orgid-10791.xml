AFA's mission is to provide optimal care and services to individuals confronting dementia, and to their caregivers and families - through member organizations dedicated to improving quality of life. AFA believes that by raising awareness of the disease and educating healthcare professionals and the public at large, we will: help remove the stigma of the disease; lead to early detection and proper treatment; prompt greater utilization of community resources; and ultimately improve quality of life.</mission><charity_name>Alzheimer's Foundation of America</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jeffrey Greener</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10791</orgid><administration_expenses>941144.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.120000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10001</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.204000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>41.240000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Diseases, Disorders, and Disciplines</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.022000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>3580126.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.460000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>31.15</financial_score><street_address_1>322 Eighth Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>58.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>7th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Eric Hall</current_ceo_name><ein>911792864</ein><total_expenses>7778395.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.418000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>757938.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>3257125.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Caring for the nation . . .one person at a time</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.090000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10791/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
