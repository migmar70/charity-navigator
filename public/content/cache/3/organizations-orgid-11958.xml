WorldTeach was founded by a group of Harvard students in 1986, in response to the need for educational assistance in developing countries. It also addressed a growing interest among people in the U.S. and elsewhere to serve, teach and learn as volunteers overseas. Since its inception, WorldTeach has placed thousands of volunteer educators in communities throughout Asia, Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe and the Pacific. Based at the Center for International Development at Harvard University, WorldTeach offers the benefits of a well-established volunteer organization, while also providing more comprehensive, personalized support and training as a small NGO.</mission><charity_name>WorldTeach</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Michael Kremer</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11958</orgid><administration_expenses>136688.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.045000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Cambridge</city><cob_title>Founder, President of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>02138</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.087000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>67.880000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.109000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2843542.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.951000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>67.01</financial_score><street_address_1>One Brattle Square</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>5th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Helen Claire Sievers</current_ceo_name><ein>043136110</ein><total_expenses>2988504.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.002000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1754933.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>8274.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Dedicated to international development, education and cultural exchange</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.580000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11958/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
