In order for citizens to effectively exercise their voices in a democracy, they should be informed about the problems and choices that they face. CEPR is committed to presenting issues in an accurate and understandable manner, so that the public is better prepared to choose among the various policy options. Toward this end, CEPR conducts both professional research and public education. An informed public should be able to choose policies that lead to an improving quality of life, both for people within the United States and around the world.</mission><charity_name>Center for Economic and Policy Research</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Co-Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10172</orgid><administration_expenses>120254.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.060000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20009</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.023000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.190000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Research and Public Policy Institutions</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.058000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1762275.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.885000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>61.56</financial_score><street_address_1>1611 Connecticut Avenue, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 400</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Dean Baker</current_ceo_name><ein>522204029</ein><total_expenses>1989187.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.053000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1898590.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>106658.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Promoting democratic debate on economic and social issues</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.950000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10172/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
