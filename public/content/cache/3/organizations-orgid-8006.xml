LLLI was founded in 1956 to give information and encouragement, mainly through personal help, to all mothers who want to breastfeed their babies. While complementing the care of the physician and other health care professionals, it recognizes the unique importance of one mother helping another to perceive the needs of her child and to learn the best means of fulfilling those needs.</mission><charity_name>La Leche League International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Cynthia Garrison &amp; Shera Lyn Parpia</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8006</orgid><administration_expenses>355343.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.186000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Schaumburg</city><cob_title>Co-Chairs</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>60173</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.084000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>44.400000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Children's and Family Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.114000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1342381.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.704000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>34.48</financial_score><street_address_1>957 North Plum Grove Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Barbara Emanuel</current_ceo_name><ein>362514518</ein><total_expenses>1905162.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.108000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1812595.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>207438.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Happy mothers, breastfed babies</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.940000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8006/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
