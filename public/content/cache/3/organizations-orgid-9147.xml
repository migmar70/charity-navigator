To date Shared Interest has assisted more than 450,000 of the country's most economically disenfranchised people. Shared Interest provides low-income South Africans of color with access to credit to launch small businesses, create jobs and build secure new communities. Shared Interest borrows money in the U.S. to build its fund to guarantee loans for South Africa's township and rural borrowers and its budding financial institutions.</mission><charity_name>Shared Interest</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Linnie Mclean</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9147</orgid><administration_expenses>79916.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.061000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10001</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.035000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.300000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.035000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1056239.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.809000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>59.61</financial_score><street_address_1>121 West 27th Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 905</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Donna Katzin</current_ceo_name><ein>133836581</ein><total_expenses>1304630.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.129000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1681400.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>168475.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Investing in South Africa's future</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.280000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9147/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
