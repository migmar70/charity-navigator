The mission of the Acton Institute is to promote a free, virtuous, and humane society. This direction recognizes the benefits of a limited government, but also the beneficent consequences of a free market. It embraces an objective framework of moral values, but also recognizes and appreciates the subjective nature of economic value. It views justice as a duty of all to give the one his due but, more importantly, as an individual obligation to serve the common good and not just his own needs and wants. In order to promote a more profound understanding of the coming together of faith and liberty, the Institute involves members of religious, business, and academic spheres in its various seminars, publications, and academic activities.</mission><charity_name>Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>David Humphreys</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6986</orgid><administration_expenses>378483.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.074000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Grand Rapids</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>49503</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.084000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>57.460000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MI</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Advocacy and Civil Rights</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.016000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>4169740.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.820000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>56.09</financial_score><street_address_1>161 Ottawa Avenue, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 301</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Kris Alan Mauren</current_ceo_name><ein>382926822</ein><total_expenses>5080196.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.104000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>7284853.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>531973.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Promoting a free and virtuous society</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.430000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6986/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
