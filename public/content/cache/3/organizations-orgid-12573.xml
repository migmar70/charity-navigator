Each box supplies an extended family of up to 10 people with a tent and essential equipment to use while they are displaced or homeless. The contents are tailored depending on the nature and location of the disaster, with great care taken sourcing every item to ensure it is robust enough to be of lasting value. The value of a box is $1,000 including delivery direct to those who need it. Each box bears its own unique number so as a donor you can track your box all the way to its recipient country via the website. Highly trained ShelterBox Response Teams distribute boxes on the ground, working closely with local organizations, international aid agencies and Rotary clubs worldwide.&#xD;

Since its inception in 2000, ShelterBox has firmly established itself at the forefront of international disaster relief, providing emergency shelter for the people who need it most on every continent.</mission><charity_name>ShelterBox USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Bill Decker</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12573</orgid><administration_expenses>758320.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.189000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Lakewood Ranch</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>34242</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.513000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.100000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>FL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.376000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>3108026.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.775000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.25</financial_score><street_address_1>7359 Merchant Court</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Emily Sperling</current_ceo_name><ein>200471604</ein><total_expenses>4006775.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.035000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1657552.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>140429.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Delivering emergency shelter, warmth and dignity to people affected by disaster worldwide</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.410000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12573/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
