The approach is simple: children and adults alike hand-pack meals designed specially for starving children, and FMSC ships the meals to more than 70 countries around the world. In 2011, FMSC produced 133 million meals with over 565,000 volunteers. From its beginnings, Feed My Starving Children has worked to develop a food mixture that would be easy and safe to transport, simple to make with only boiling water, and culturally acceptable worldwide. While the formula was designed to save the lives of severely malnourished and starving children, the ingredients also improve the health, growth and physical well-being of children who are no longer in immediate danger of starvation.</mission><charity_name>Feed My Starving Children</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Tad Weiss</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9307</orgid><administration_expenses>1091906.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.067000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Coon Rapids</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>55433</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.227000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.140000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.453000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>14207714.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.879000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.79</financial_score><street_address_1>401 93rd Avenue NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Mark Crea</current_ceo_name><ein>411601449</ein><total_expenses>16151352.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.052000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>3405314.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>851732.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Feeding God's starving children hungry in body and spirit</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.210000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9307/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
