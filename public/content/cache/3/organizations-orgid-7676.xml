Our mission is to make significant contributions to Pratham's goal of every child in school and learning well by raising awareness about the problem of illiteracy in India and by raising funds to support Pratham's projects. Pratham's direct programs are focused primarily in urban slums. The programs are typically run in spaces provided by the community and are conducted by members of the community. In 2007- 2008, Pratham's direct programs reached over 5,500 communities across 15 states, benefiting over a million children. Pratham's flagship program Read India works with governments, communities and parents to improve the reading, writing and arithmetic skills of children aged 6-14 years.</mission><charity_name>Pratham USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Arvind Sanger</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7676</orgid><administration_expenses>183322.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.021000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Houston</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>77036</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.473000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>66.410000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.384000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>7908332.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.939000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>66.89</financial_score><street_address_1>5890 Point West Drive</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Atul Varadhachary</current_ceo_name><ein>760620808</ein><total_expenses>8421968.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.039000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>7241768.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>330314.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Every child in school and learning well</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.850000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>2</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7676/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
