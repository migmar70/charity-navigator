In the beginning our world revolved around the health and well-being of 45 youngsters. Today we care for more than 700 children, and we have extended our services to provide for their families and communities and crisis. CCF was founded by former film executive Scott Neeson, who traveled to Cambodia on holiday in early 2003 and found his life changed by the desperate circumstances and unlikely courage of Phnom Penh's most impoverished children.</mission><charity_name>Cambodian Children's Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Scott Neeson</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12748</orgid><administration_expenses>271082.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.098000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Santa Monica</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>90404</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.479000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>65.940000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>0</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.535000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2305912.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.839000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>65.89</financial_score><street_address_1>2461 Santa Monica Blvd. </street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>PMB 833</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Scott Neeson</current_ceo_name><ein>200764162</ein><total_expenses>2746096.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.061000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1761866.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>169102.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing life-changing education, nourishment and healing</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.640000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>0</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12748/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
