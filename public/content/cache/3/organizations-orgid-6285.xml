We envision a worldwide network of interconnected ministries committed to the ongoing process of Christ-like sanctification and renewal, and staffed by teams of leaders who are trained using a biblical pattern of discipleship. Realizing the strategic position held by universities as centers of influence in our culture, WDA initiated its ministry on college campuses. We continue to build disciples on college campuses, but also focus on developing other centers, partnerships, publications and resources that equip disciple builders, both in the US and overseas.</mission><charity_name>Worldwide Discipleship Association</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Ross Greene</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6285</orgid><administration_expenses>138558.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>0</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.102000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>Fayetteville</city><cob_title>Board Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>30214</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.012000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>34.420000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>GA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.002000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>1123468.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.828000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>58.58</financial_score><street_address_1>110 Carnegie Place</street_address_1><accountability_score>21.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 100</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Robert D Bob Dukes</current_ceo_name><ein>581211155</ein><total_expenses>1355310.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.068000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>491564.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>93284.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Disciple building</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.360000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6285/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
