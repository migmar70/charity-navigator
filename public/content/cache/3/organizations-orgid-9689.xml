The greatest actors and actresses of the times had toured through Dallas as soon as there were railroads to bring them. Dallas Theater Center, with its roots deeply implanted in the community, continues to grow in stature as one of the most exciting regional theaters in the country today. The Theater Center remains fully responsive to the time and place in which we live; to the issues that shape our lives and thoughts; and to the rhythms, images and contradictions of contemporary American life.</mission><charity_name>Dallas Theater Center</charity_name><current_ceo_title>General Manager</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Rebecca Fletcher</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9689</orgid><administration_expenses>2785505.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.339000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>Dallas</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>75201</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.048000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.350000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Performing Arts</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.144000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>4961795.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.603000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.03</financial_score><street_address_1>2400 Flora Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Hillary J.
