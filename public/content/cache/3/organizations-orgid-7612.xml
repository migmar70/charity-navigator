We establish and operate infant nurture and preschool programs, provide personalized learning for older children and establish loving permanent family care, medical care, and guidance for children with disabilities. It is our goal to ensure that every orphaned child has a caring adult in her life and a chance at a bright future. Since Half the Sky began its work in China, more than fifty thousand children have benefited from one or more of our five innovative programs: The Infant Nurture Program; The Little Sisters Preschool Program; The Youth Services Program; and The Family Village Program; and the China Care Home.</mission><charity_name>Half the Sky Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Guy Russo</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7612</orgid><administration_expenses>440776.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.061000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Berkeley</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94710</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.217000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.670000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.304000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>5965473.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.827000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>57.79</financial_score><street_address_1>715 Hearst Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>62.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 200</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jenny Bowen</current_ceo_name><ein>954714047</ein><total_expenses>7212593.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.111000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2744976.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>806344.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Nurturing care for China's orphaned children</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.290000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7612/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
