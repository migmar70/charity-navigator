Our goal is to help people know the saving grace of Jesus, and through Him, gain wisdom for living, find fulfillment in life and become a positive part of their community. Since our founding 1954, we have desired to provide not only meals and beds, but also support and long-term treatment for men and women with addictions and other debilitating problems.</mission><charity_name>Nashville Rescue Mission</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Bob McKinney</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4149</orgid><administration_expenses>685400.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.060000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Nashville</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>37203    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.041000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>55.510000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Homeless Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.057000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>8536065.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.756000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>49.91</financial_score><street_address_1>639 Lafayette Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Glenn Cranfield</current_ceo_name><ein>626018832</ein><total_expenses>11277471.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.182000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>14050780.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>2056006.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping the hurting of Middle Tennessee</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.210000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4149/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
