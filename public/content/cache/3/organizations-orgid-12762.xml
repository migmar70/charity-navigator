ADWAS believes that violence is a learned behavior and envisions a world where violence is not tolerated. ADWAS was founded in 1986 and is located in Seattle, Washington. The ADWAS model has been replicated in 19 Deaf communities across the United States. ADWAS established the nation's first transitional housing, A Place of Our Own. We are committed to providing accessible and safe housing for Deaf and Deaf-Blind women and their children.</mission><charity_name>Abused Deaf Women's Advocacy Services</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Rob Roth</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12762</orgid><administration_expenses>55353.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.035000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Seattle</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>98115</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.032000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>57.080000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>WA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Social Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.073000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1296286.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.830000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>58.28</financial_score><street_address_1>8623 Roosevelt Way, NE</street_address_1><accountability_score>56.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Tiffany Williams</current_ceo_name><ein>911339173</ein><total_expenses>1560054.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.133000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2593979.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>208415.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing comprehensive services to deaf and deaf-blind victims/survivors of sexual assault</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.660000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12762/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
