SMC works to protect endangered manatees and their aquatic habitat for future generations. In order to recover the manatee population, or delist the species, our goals are: to protect ample healthy habitat to support a stable or growing manatee population; to reduce manatee harassment, injuries and deaths from human activity; to ensure that sufficient regulations have been adopted to accomplish these goals. In order to accomplish our objective and goals we concentrate our efforts on reducing the negative impacts to manatees and their aquatic habitat caused by human activity.</mission><charity_name>Save the Manatee Club</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jimmy Buffett and Helen Digges Spivey</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6316</orgid><administration_expenses>115126.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.089000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Maitland</city><cob_title>Board Co-Chairs</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>32751</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.050000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>45.040000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>FL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Wildlife Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.027000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1104350.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.855000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.14</financial_score><street_address_1>500 North Maitland Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>44.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Patrick Rose</current_ceo_name><ein>593131709</ein><total_expenses>1290193.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.054000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>705514.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>70717.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Protecting manatees and their aquatic habitats</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.380000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6316/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
