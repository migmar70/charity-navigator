Since the JBFC opened its doors to the public in June 2001, more than a million people have seen over 3,000 films from every corner of the globe. Nearly 60,000 students in grades 3-12 and in college have participated in our education programs, more than 50% of them from underserved communities throughout the tri-state area. Our education programs are grounded in 21st century literacy skills, including critical viewing and production. These skills are essential for a generation growing up in a world in which media and technology is increasingly the way we participate in community, and engage in democracy and the global economy.</mission><charity_name>Jacob Burns Film Center</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>David Swope</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10231</orgid><administration_expenses>389001.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.059000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>Pleasantville</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10570</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.084000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.050000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Performing Arts</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.168000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>5641231.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.867000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.67</financial_score><street_address_1>364 Manville Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Stephen Apkon</current_ceo_name><ein>134038441</ein><total_expenses>6500110.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.072000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>25904878.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>469878.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Nonprofit.
