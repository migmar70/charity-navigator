The KIA's mission is to cultivate the creation and appreciation of the visual arts for the communities of West Michigan. The museum's 10 galleries showcase outstanding temporary exhibitions and the KIA's significant permanent collection. While the collection's emphasis is 20th-century American painting and sculpture, it also includes a European and American print collection, as well as important collections of photography and contemporary ceramics. The collection includes works by local, national, and international artists.</mission><charity_name>Kalamazoo Institute of Arts</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Courtenay VanderMolen</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10322</orgid><administration_expenses>2292431.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.464000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>Kalamazoo</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>49007</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.061000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>45.830000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MI</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Museums</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.021000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>2255694.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.457000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>37.65</financial_score><street_address_1>314 South Park Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>James Bridenstine</current_ceo_name><ein>381617060</ein><total_expenses>4931292.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.077000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>35140120.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>383167.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Cultivating the creation and appreciation of the visual arts</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>7.070000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10322/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
