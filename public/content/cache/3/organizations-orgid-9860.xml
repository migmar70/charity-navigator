The organization also brings children from Africa to the US for training and care integrated with a touring program. One of Music For Life Institute's main programs is the African Children's Choir. The African Children's Choir is made up of some of the neediest and most vulnerable children in their countries. The African Children's Choir helps these children break away from the everyday cycle of poverty and hopelessness. While touring with the Choir, the children are exposed to a world of new possibilities. After returning to Africa, the children receive a quality education, leadership training and spiritual ministry at the Music for Life Primary School at well-equipped schools in their respective countries.</mission><charity_name>Music For Life Institute</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9860</orgid><administration_expenses>424833.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.149000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Bellingham</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>0</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>98228</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.088000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>40.440000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>WA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.090000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>2389882.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.842000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>40.89</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
