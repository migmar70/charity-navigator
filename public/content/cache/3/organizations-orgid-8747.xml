Millions of images of approximately 1,500 children have bombarded our nations' elementary schools and, through this method, we have assisted in the recovery of over 1,200 missing children. We are a parent advocacy group and we serve as an information clearinghouse. Our web site is created as a resource for parents of missing children as well as lawyers, other non-profits and non-governmental agencies, and the agencies that must deal with child abduction. Our belief is that the parents of missing and abducted children have a right to be involved in the search for their own children.</mission><charity_name>The Committee for Missing Children</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Barbara Kurth</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8747</orgid><administration_expenses>42317.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.019000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Lawrenceville</city><cob_title>President of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>30045</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.069000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>19.060000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>GA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Advocacy and Civil Rights</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.112000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>0</overall_rating><program_expenses>243343.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.111000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>0.00</financial_score><street_address_1>242 Stone Mountain Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>53.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>David C.
