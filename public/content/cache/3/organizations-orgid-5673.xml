In this past year, the food bank distributed 46 million pounds of product to its member agencies. The member agencies give the food to hungry individuals and families in their service areas, either by distributing groceries, or preparing the food into meals. We also offer nutrition courses, a culinary academy and a Kids Caf&#xC3;&#xA9;. In 2008, the Houston Food Bank merged with End Hunger Network. End Hunger Network is a human service organization which has worked for more than two decades to develop a system that can solve hunger problems.</mission><charity_name>Houston Food Bank</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Benjamin Samuels</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5673</orgid><administration_expenses>3070088.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.023000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Houston</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>77029</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.393000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.730000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.336000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>126422402.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.962000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>69.62</financial_score><street_address_1>535 Portwall</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Brian Greene</current_ceo_name><ein>742181456</ein><total_expenses>131399457.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.014000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>66898753.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1906967.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Filling pantries.
