Through Earth Force young people get hands-on, real-world opportunities to practice civic skills, acquire and understand environmental knowledge, and develop the skills and motivation to become life-long leaders in addressing community issues. Earth Force achieves these results by training and supporting educators as they implement our unique six-step model for engaging young people. Earth Force knows that little can be accomplished by working alone and we create innovative partnerships with businesses, schools, community-based organizations, and civic leaders nationwide.</mission><charity_name>Earth Force</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Chris Chopyak</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10076</orgid><administration_expenses>104345.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.047000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Environment</category><city>Denver</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>80211</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.072000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.850000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CO</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Botanical Gardens, Parks, and Nature Centers</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.058000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1838924.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.837000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>44.65</financial_score><street_address_1>2555 W. 34th Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Lisa Bardwell</current_ceo_name><ein>521830873</ein><total_expenses>2196602.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.115000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>994708.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>253333.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Engaging Youth.
