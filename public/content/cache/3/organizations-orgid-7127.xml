Since its beginning in 1989, Days End has been a place where children and adults have found enrichment, satisfaction, sadness and purpose through helping to provide care for unwanted, abused or neglected horses. Days End has gone from a small non-profit sheltering only a few horses annually, to a full scale and well respected rescue and rehabilitation facility housing on average 50 to 60 horses at any given point in time.</mission><charity_name>Days End Farm Horse Rescue</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, Co-Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Suzanne Schooler</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7127</orgid><administration_expenses>105664.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.090000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Woodbine</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>21797</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.399000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>65.660000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.104000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1024899.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.877000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.77</financial_score><street_address_1>1372 Woodbine Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>64.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Kathleen Schwartz-Howe</current_ceo_name><ein>521759077</ein><total_expenses>1168476.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.032000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2072218.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>37913.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Ensuring quality care and treatment of horses through intervention, education, and outreach</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.670000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7127/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
