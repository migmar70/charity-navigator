The counties we serve are some of the poorest in the nation, yet some of the fastest growing in South Dakota. Eagle Butte, located near the center of the reservation, serves as tribal headquarters and is the largest community in the region. Founded by the Congregation of the Priests of the Sacred Heart, the Center remains true to the vision of the brotherhood and its founder, Father Leo John Dehon. Father Dehon was committed to service to the poor, meeting people's physical and spiritual needs through social services, and helping them to better lives. His commitment to care is still expressed in the Sacred Heart Center's passionate dedication to provide needed services to the people.</mission><charity_name>Sacred Heart Center</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12260</orgid><administration_expenses>399339.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.112000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Eagle Butte</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>57625</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.015000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>18.110000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>SD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Social Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.095000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>0</overall_rating><program_expenses>1041250.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.292000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>0.00</financial_score><street_address_1>121 Landmark Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>48.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>P.O.
