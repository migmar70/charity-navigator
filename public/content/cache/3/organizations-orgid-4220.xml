For 29 years, NIF has been a leader in building a just and strong Israel, believing that Israel's strength depends as much on its commitment to democratic principles as on its ability to defend itself against physical and military threats. Since its founding in 1979, NIF has granted more than $200 million to more than 800 organizations in Israel. Many of those institutions are now able to stand on their own, and others attract support from a variety of other organizations. Meanwhile, the New Israel Fund constantly invests in new organizations and takes on new challenges.</mission><charity_name>New Israel Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Naomi Chazan</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4220</orgid><administration_expenses>3448445.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.112000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10001</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.090000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.870000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.029000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>24868303.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.809000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.68</financial_score><street_address_1>330 Seventh Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>11th floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Daniel Sokatch</current_ceo_name><ein>942607722</ein><total_expenses>30715507.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.078000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>26361282.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>2398759.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Promoting equality for all Israelis</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.780000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4220/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
