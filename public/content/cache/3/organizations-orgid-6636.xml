Families Forward assists families in financial crisis to achieve and maintain self-sufficiency. We do not just provide support; we supply the tools for families to move from depending upon public services to return to being independent, productive residents of the community. At Families Forward, we give families renewed self-confidence and the tools they need to succeed in life. Last year, Families Forward assisted over 6,000 individuals through housing, counseling, food, referrals, school supplies, career coaching, and other services.</mission><charity_name>Families Forward</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mark Harryman</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6636</orgid><administration_expenses>178017.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.062000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Irvine</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>92618</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.289000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.100000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Children's and Family Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.228000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2500889.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.873000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.73</financial_score><street_address_1>9221 Irvine Boulevard</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Margie Wakeham</current_ceo_name><ein>330086043</ein><total_expenses>2861923.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.063000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>6918619.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>183017.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Hope.
