From its founding in 1937, the Tax Foundation has been grounded in the belief that the dissemination of basic information about government finance is the foundation of sound policy in a free society. In the subsequent seven decades, the Tax Foundation has been a national leader in promoting a sense of tax consciousness in the public. Its distribution of information has helped provide policy makers with the lay of the land in the ongoing debate over tax and budget policies, as well as with a greater understanding of the policies proposed.</mission><charity_name>Tax Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>David P.
