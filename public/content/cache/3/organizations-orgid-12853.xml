The founders of Yad Ezra learned that there were impoverished Jews living in the community who relied heavily on government assistance programs including food stamps. Yad Ezra was founded to alleviate some of our clients' financial burdens by distributing groceries on a monthly basis to families in need. During 1990, Yad Ezra served an average of 250 families every month. Current statistics indicate that we provide an average of 1,600 impoverished families (almost 3,300 individuals) with food, health care items and household goods every month. In addition, Yad Ezra distributes appropriate foods that help enhance the clients' celebration of every Jewish holiday.</mission><charity_name>Yad Ezra</charity_name><current_ceo_title></current_ceo_title><cob_name>Richard Simtob</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12853</orgid><administration_expenses>99199.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.056000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Berkley</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>48072</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.205000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.350000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MI</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.094000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1535917.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.879000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.72</financial_score><street_address_1>2850 West 11 Mile Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>60.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name></current_ceo_name><ein>382904733</ein><total_expenses>1746004.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.063000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>3924010.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>110888.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Feeding the Jewish hungry</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.410000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12853/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
