As a leading independent research and education organization, the Institute generates positive and sustainable policy solutions for citizens and lawmakers that help unleash talent and entrepreneurial ability. The Illinois Policy Institute's approach is to transform liberty principles into marketable policies that become law. The ultimate sign of success is when free market ideas are turned into law and change lives for the better. What does this look like? Individuals and businesses become more prosperous without the fear of government favoritism or interference, families can choose a high quality education for their kids, and citizens respect their government because it is open and transparent to all.</mission><charity_name>Illinois Policy Institute</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Andy McKenna</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>13185</orgid><administration_expenses>167349.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.096000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Chicago</city><cob_title>Board Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>60603</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.735000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>61.680000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Research and Public Policy Institutions</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.881000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1397518.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.806000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.56</financial_score><street_address_1>190 South LaSalle</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1630</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>John Tillman</current_ceo_name><ein>412057028</ein><total_expenses>1732183.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.096000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>176631.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>167316.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Promoting personal freedom and prosperity in Illinois and America</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.100000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/13185/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
