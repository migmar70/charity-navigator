Since its inception, Hadassah has remained unwavering in its devotion to Judaism, Zionism, and American ideals. As the largest volunteer organization and the largest women's organization in America, Hadassah is committed to strengthening the unity of the Jewish people. In Israel, we accomplish this through progressive healthcare, education, youth institutions, volunteerism, and land reclamation. In the U.S. we reach our goals through Jewish and Zionist education programs, Zionist Youth programs, and health awareness programs, as well as by advocating for issues of importance to women and to the American Jewish community. This organization had investments with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. A one time write off of investment losses as a result of fraud may have an adverse affect on the organizations expenses and working capital for this evaluation period.</mission><charity_name>Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Organization of America</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director/CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Marcie Natan</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7699</orgid><administration_expenses>61808791.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.452000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10019</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.088000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>42.640000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.112000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>65735128.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.481000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>31.52</financial_score><street_address_1>50 West 58th Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Janice Weinman</current_ceo_name><ein>131656651</ein><total_expenses>136654319.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.066000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>398096983.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>9110400.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Devoted to Judaism, Zionism, and American ideals</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.150000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7699/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
