Established in 1982, Aleh believes that every child, regardless of the severity of the physical or cognitive disability, has the right to benefit from the best available care and develop to his or her full potential. Its four facilities provide 650 children and young adults with all the specialized services they need to live a quality life: residential living, medical care, rehabilitative and therapeutic treatment, special education, vocational training opportunities, and social and cultural activities. As Israel's largest organization for the severely disabled, Aleh's groundbreaking rehabilitative concepts are changing social perceptions regarding the care for the most vulnerable amongst us.</mission><charity_name>Aleh Negev Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jeffrey Tenenbaum</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6705</orgid><administration_expenses>57791.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.058000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10021</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.308000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>39.930000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>0</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.289000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>829444.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.838000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>39.88</financial_score><street_address_1>42 East 69th Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>40.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Joseph Loshinsky</current_ceo_name><ein>112716763</ein><total_expenses>989368.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.103000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>621841.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>102133.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Caring for Israel's severely disabled, together</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.620000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6705/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
