Variety is made up of men and women primarily in the entertainment industry who raise the much-needed funds to help children in the Southern California community. A majority of the money raised in our community stays in our community, and our primary goal is to provide support wherever the need is greatest. In our 67 years of existence, we have raised more than $60 million to help thousands of children. Variety prides itself on being able to modify its agenda in order to meet new trends and evolving conditions; addressing each case in a timely, impartial manner.</mission><charity_name>Variety the Children's Charity of Southern California</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Alan Davy</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10418</orgid><administration_expenses>66993.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.073000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Los Angeles</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>90010</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.044000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>62.390000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Fundraising Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.115000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>688991.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.751000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.01</financial_score><street_address_1>4601 Wilshire Boulevard</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Elizabeth O'Neil</current_ceo_name><ein>951330495</ein><total_expenses>917390.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.175000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>839419.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>161406.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing life saving support</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.910000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10418/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
