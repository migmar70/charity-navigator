The global mission of AGI is to send authentic, life-giving gifts to a needy world -- gifts that build a partnership with oppressed people in crisis and that protect and preserve the earth's endangered environment -- to nourish and sustain a more equitable and peaceful global community. Each year AGI develops a global shopping list designed to meet the needs of hungry-sick-homeless people and our endangered planet. In order to send designated gifts overseas and to poverty areas of the United States it is necessary to cooperate with many sending agencies. AGI has chosen nonprofit agencies with excellent reputations and track records to send its gifts to the poor. Over 80 validated nonprofit agencies and their established projects have received grants to benefit their international mission.</mission><charity_name>Alternative Gifts International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Joe Goetz</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8765</orgid><administration_expenses>71297.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.076000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Wichita</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>67214</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.141000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>50.880000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>KS</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.155000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>849891.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.912000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>43.89</financial_score><street_address_1>1103 North Topeka Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Tony Princ</current_ceo_name><ein>954111142</ein><total_expenses>931668.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.011000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>323766.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>10480.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Gifts inspiring change</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.340000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8765/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
