By providing extensive medical, social and educational programs devoted to children, China Care makes a lasting contribution to our shared future. We are dedicated to providing critical medical care to the orphaned children of China and determined to inspire our youth to make the world a better place. In 2009, China Care Foundation formed an alliance with Half the Sky Foundation, combining the strengths of our two organizations. Where Half the Sky offers education and nurture, China Care offers the specialized medical care and nurture necessary for these children to not only survive, but also to thrive. Since the Board of Directors underwrites our administration and overhead expenses, 100% of your donation goes directly toward saving and improving the lives of the children in our care.</mission><charity_name>China Care Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Raymond Dalio</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11282</orgid><administration_expenses>269787.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.110000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Westport</city><cob_title>Founder &amp; Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>06881</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.103000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>57.060000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CT</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.146000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1975833.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.812000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>51.95</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
