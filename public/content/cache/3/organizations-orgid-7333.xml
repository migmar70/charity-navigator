To accomplish this mission the Foundation has targeted four goals: advocacy, conservation, education and research. As part of its conservation activities, GBF owns about 3,000 acres of property identified as having significant habitat or educational value. Galveston Bay Expeditions, GBF's outdoor education program, annually draws close to 1,000 participants who explore the Bay as part of youth, adult, family, or teacher expeditions. Thousands more are introduced to the Bay each year through GBF's Bay Day festival and celebration.</mission><charity_name>Galveston Bay Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>James Doyle</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7333</orgid><administration_expenses>212979.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.106000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Environment</category><city>Webster</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>77598</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.089000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.070000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Environmental Protection and Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.006000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1694291.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.847000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.97</financial_score><street_address_1>17330 Highway 3</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Bob Stokes</current_ceo_name><ein>760279876</ein><total_expenses>1999582.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.046000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1389556.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>92312.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Preserving, protecting and enhancing Galveston Bay</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.660000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7333/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
