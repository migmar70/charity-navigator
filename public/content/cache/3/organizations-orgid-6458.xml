During its more than 30 years of existence and growth, the TS Alliance has expanded its mission to improve the quality of life for individuals and families affected by TSC through the stimulation and sponsorship of research, the development of programs, support services and resource information, and the development and implementation of public and professional education programs designed to heighten awareness of TSC. TSC is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form in many different organs, primarily in the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, skin and lungs.</mission><charity_name>Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>David Parkes</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6458</orgid><administration_expenses>571483.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.182000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Silver Spring</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20910</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.009000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>50.800000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Diseases, Disorders, and Disciplines</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.074000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>2046181.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.652000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>42.85</financial_score><street_address_1>801 Roeder Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 750</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Kari Luther Rosbeck</current_ceo_name><ein>953018799</ein><total_expenses>3133909.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.164000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>7400159.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>516245.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Finding a cure for tuberous sclerosis while improving lives of those affected</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.070000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6458/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
