At its essence, WLP is a builder of networks, working with 18 autonomous and independent partner organizations in the Global South, particularly in Muslim-majority societies, to empower women to transform their families, communities, and societies. We strongly believe that women, working in partnership, will learn the skills and implement the strategies needed to secure human rights, contribute to the development of their communities, and ultimately create a more peaceful world. Our primary objectives are to increase the number of women taking on leadership and decision-making roles at family, community, and national levels, and to improve the effectiveness of feminist movements in Muslim-majority societies and globally by strengthening the capacity of our partner organizations.</mission><charity_name>Women's Learning Partnership</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Thoraya Obaid</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8822</orgid><administration_expenses>112491.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.061000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Bethesda</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20814</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.024000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>67.140000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.087000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1664680.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.908000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>67.29</financial_score><street_address_1>4343 Montgomery Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>67.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 201</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Mahnaz Afkhami</current_ceo_name><ein>522199581</ein><total_expenses>1831823.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.029000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2507722.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>54652.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>For rights, development, and peace</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.360000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8822/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
