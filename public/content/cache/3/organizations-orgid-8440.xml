Its focus is the Israeli family who is faced with the dilemma of an untimely or medically at risk pregnancy. When pregnant women are grappling with difficult choices, it is important for them to know that they are not alone, that there is an organization that they can turn to for assistance. Nefesh Achat has set for itself the goal of providing a safety net and a listening ear to pregnant women who are confronted with financial, emotional or medical difficulties.</mission><charity_name>Just One Life/Nefesh Achat B'Yisrael</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Vice President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jack Forgash &amp; Steven Adelsberg</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8440</orgid><administration_expenses>147634.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.144000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Co-Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10017</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.008000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>32.610000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.069000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>486996.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.478000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>26.47</financial_score><street_address_1>587 Fifth Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>40.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 702</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Etan Tokayer</current_ceo_name><ein>133533863</ein><total_expenses>1018411.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.376000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>-50723.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>383781.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>A pregnant woman's needs are as important as her baby's</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>-0.040000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8440/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
