The Okizu Foundation operates Camp Okizu which began with the belief that a residential camp can be an ideal setting for children struggling with a life threatening illness to explore and enjoy a normal life experience. Children who are diagnosed with cancer miss a normal childhood. Their illness, treatment and complications can keep them from enjoying activities that often are taken for granted. And yet these children, like all children, need the opportunity to grow, experiment and discover independence. The Okizu Foundation is committed to the continuing support of the oncology and siblings camping programs.</mission><charity_name>Okizu Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>John Bell</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8098</orgid><administration_expenses>75890.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.053000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Novato</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94949</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.087000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.900000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Patient and Family Support</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.034000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1177805.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.823000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.73</financial_score><street_address_1>16 Digital Drive</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Suzanne Randall</current_ceo_name><ein>680291178</ein><total_expenses>1429491.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.122000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>5588932.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>175796.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Supporting families with childhood cancer</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>3.900000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8098/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
