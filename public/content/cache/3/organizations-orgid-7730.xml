Family Care International was the first international organization dedicated to maternal health, founded out of a determination to remedy this neglect. FCI pursues a world where no woman suffers preventable injury or death from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes and in which all people can enjoy their sexual and reproductive health and rights. FCI - one of the world's leading voices for maternal and reproductive health - fights for political commitment, stronger policies, and more funding for programs that save women's lives. FCI also works with local partners and communities to create innovative solutions, raise awareness, and implement effective programs that improve maternal and reproductive health outcomes in the communities where women are still dying every day. FCI was the 2008 recipient of the United Nations Population Award.</mission><charity_name>Family Care International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Anne Tinker</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7730</orgid><administration_expenses>831742.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.175000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chair of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10012</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.171000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>57.600000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.065000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3762096.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.794000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>52.94</financial_score><street_address_1>588 Broadway</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 503</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Ann Starrs</current_ceo_name><ein>133228334</ein><total_expenses>4737835.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.030000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>3421358.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>143997.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Making pregnancy and childbirth safer around the world</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.720000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7730/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
