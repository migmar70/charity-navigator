The mission of Action Against Hunger is to save lives by eliminating hunger through the prevention, detection, and treatment of malnutrition, especially during and after emergency situations of conflict, war and natural disaster. From crisis to sustainability, we tackle the underlying causes of malnutrition and its effects by using our expertise in nutrition, food security, water and sanitation, health and advocacy. By integrating our programs with local and national systems we further ensure that short-term interventions become long-term solutions.</mission><charity_name>Action Against Hunger | ACF-USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Raymond Debbane</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3212</orgid><administration_expenses>4813964.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.115000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10018</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.196000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>66.500000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.123000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>35785251.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.857000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>66.07</financial_score><street_address_1>247 West 37th Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>67.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>10th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Nan Dale</current_ceo_name><ein>133327220</ein><total_expenses>41720946.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.026000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>29212534.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1121731.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing innovative solutions to world hunger</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.700000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3212/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
