In 2001 GHS opened a new state-of-the-art 10,500 square foot facility in Russell Township, Ohio. We named it Rescue Village. Animals at Rescue Village are cared for until they find a new home, including those that are abused, sick or injured, those that may need behavior training, or those that simply need the gift of time. Animals are never euthanized due to age, special needs, or lack of space. At GHS our mission is to shelter and find homes for sick, injured, abused, and abandoned domestic animals that have no other alternatives; to foster compassion for all living things through education; to reduce pet overpopulation through spay/neuter programs; and to prevent cruelty by enforcing animal protection laws.</mission><charity_name>Geauga Humane Society</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Nancy Rubin</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7674</orgid><administration_expenses>118961.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.084000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Russell Township</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>44072</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.085000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>50.690000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>OH</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.065000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1118404.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.793000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>49.48</financial_score><street_address_1>15463 Chillicothe Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>52.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Hope Brustein</current_ceo_name><ein>237358431</ein><total_expenses>1408730.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.121000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>6379055.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>171365.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Turning sad beginnings into happy endings since 1974</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>4.520000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7674/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
