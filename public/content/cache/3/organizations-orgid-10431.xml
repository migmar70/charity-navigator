Formerly known as Andean Rural Health Care, Curamericas Global was created in 1983 with the goal of establishing primary health care programs that are responsive to the health needs of the community, improving child survival within the community, and building the national and local capacity of health service providers. Curamericas works in Haiti, Bolivia, and Guatemala, and Liberia and its programs focus on teaching prevention and also help to establish health clinics in these areas of desperate need.</mission><charity_name>Curamericas Global</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Interim Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>John Matheson</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10431</orgid><administration_expenses>210580.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.145000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Raleigh</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>27609</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.005000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>52.280000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NC</state><reportsceoandsalary>0</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.015000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1191796.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.823000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.26</financial_score><street_address_1>318 West Millbrook Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>62.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 105</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Roger Follas</current_ceo_name><ein>561400098</ein><total_expenses>1447340.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.031000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>-7307.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>44964.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing hope through health</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>-0.020000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10431/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
