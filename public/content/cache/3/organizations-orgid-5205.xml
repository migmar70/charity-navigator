Our mission is to be responsible for developing, accepting and recognizing philanthropy in support of Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego and its subsidiary corporations. Rady Children's is San Diego region's only designated pediatric trauma center and the only area hospital dedicated solely to pediatric care.
