We envision a world in which all children can pursue a quality education that enables them to reach their full potential and contribute to their community and the world. Room to Read seeks to transform the lives of millions of children in developing countries by focusing on literacy and gender equality in education. Working in collaboration with local communities, partner organizations and governments, we develop literacy skills and a habit of reading among primary school children, and support girls to complete secondary school with the relevant life skills to succeed in school and beyond.</mission><charity_name>Room to Read</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>John Wood</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10217</orgid><administration_expenses>2243148.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.064000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>San Francisco</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94104</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.190000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>67.160000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.233000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>29612702.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.849000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>65.99</financial_score><street_address_1>111 Sutter Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>16th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Erin Ganju</current_ceo_name><ein>912003533</ein><total_expenses>34865835.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.086000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>21022391.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>3009985.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>World change starts with educated children</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.600000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10217/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
