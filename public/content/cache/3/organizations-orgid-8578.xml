Over the past decade, College Summit has worked in partnership with schools, school districts and colleges to develop a sustainable model for raising college enrollment rates in the community. College Summit builds the capacity of schools to dramatically increase college-going school- and district- wide. Trained student influencers build college-going culture, while teachers and counselors use a managed curriculum and technology tools to help all students create postsecondary plans and apply to college. We are committed to the day when every student who can make it in college makes it to college.</mission><charity_name>College Summit</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Founder and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Barry Salzberg</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8578</orgid><administration_expenses>2291273.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.120000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Education</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20009</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.012000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.510000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Other Education Programs and Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.097000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>15355376.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.804000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>61.75</financial_score><street_address_1>1763 Columbia Road, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>2nd Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>J.B.
