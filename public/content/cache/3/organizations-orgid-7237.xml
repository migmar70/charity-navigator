FGO was formed in June 1994 by the merger of Greater Miami Opera, founded in 1941, and The Opera Guild Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, founded in 1945. In addition to producing standard repertoire, FGO also presents lesser known operas by great composers, as well as commissions of works of living composers. FGO offers several highly successful outreach and educational programs including its internationally-recognized Young Artist Studio Program. The Opera presents five main-stage productions annually in the Ziff Ballet Opera House at The Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County, and at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale.</mission><charity_name>Florida Grand Opera</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Managing Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jane A.
