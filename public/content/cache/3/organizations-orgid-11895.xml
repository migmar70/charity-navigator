We are making a significant impact on the lives of orphaned children in India by:&#xD;
raising the standard of living for the children in orphanages; and reducing the number of non-orphaned children living in orphanages. The Miracle Foundation renovates existing orphanages, builds new ones, raises money for construction and finds sponsors for our children. Because the effort is so focused, there is little overhead. In India, our money goes a long way towards healthy food, tuition, better living conditions, clothing, and medical care. Love, affection, and hope for a bright future come from our incredible staff, ambassadors, and sponsors. The Miracle Foundation currently operates four Children's Homes and one home for unwed mothers.</mission><charity_name>The Miracle Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Founder, Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Krishna Srinivasan</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11895</orgid><administration_expenses>123199.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.103000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Austin</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>78703</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.039000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>54.590000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.013000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>949536.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.795000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>48.22</financial_score><street_address_1>1506 West Sixth Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Caroline Boudreaux</current_ceo_name><ein>742989580</ein><total_expenses>1193922.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.101000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>928201.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>121187.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Transforming children's lives.
