The mission of SafeHaven is to end domestic violence through safety, support, prevention and social change. The crisis line is staffed 24 hours a day by employees and trained volunteers to facilitate shelter entry and to give information and referrals. SafeHaven operates two emergency shelter facilities located in Fort Worth and Arlington. While in the shelter, residents receive meals, personal care items, clothing, transportation assistance, legal assistance, and childcare. Transitional housing is provided to victims and their children seeking self-sufficiency and independence. We also provide counseling, support groups, case management, legal assistance, play therapy and education to victims of domestic violence.</mission><charity_name>SafeHaven of Tarrant County</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Lisa Jamieson</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7601</orgid><administration_expenses>821492.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.114000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Hurst</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>76053</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.013000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>58.340000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Social Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.041000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>6028186.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.838000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.59</financial_score><street_address_1>8701 Bedford Euless Rd</street_address_1><accountability_score>62.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 600</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Mary Lee Hafley</current_ceo_name><ein>751670281</ein><total_expenses>7193391.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.047000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>5977054.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>343713.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Ending domestic violence</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.820000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7601/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
