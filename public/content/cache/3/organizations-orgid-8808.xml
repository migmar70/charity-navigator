Variety serves these children each time they need assistance, from infancy to the age of 21, providing durable medical equipment, developmental programs and resources. Variety also allocates funds to 85 partner agencies - children's charities in the Greater St. Louis region that serve children with physical and mental disabilities. Variety focuses on four core areas to help our kids become healthy and independent: gifting medical equipment for mobility &amp; independence, creating unique recreational &amp; therapeutic programs, funding 85 strong partner programs, and raising funds &amp; awareness in St. Louis.</mission><charity_name>Variety the Children's Charity of St. Louis</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>David Steward</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8808</orgid><administration_expenses>326297.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.113000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>St. Louis</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>63146</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0E-15</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>58.130000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MO</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Fundraising Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.059000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>2068573.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.722000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>53.22</financial_score><street_address_1>2200 Westport Plaza Drive</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jan Albus</current_ceo_name><ein>436078016</ein><total_expenses>2863891.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.163000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>3952401.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>469021.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping children with physical and mental disabilities reach their full potential</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.380000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8808/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
