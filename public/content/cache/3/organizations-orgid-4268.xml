We provide material and financial assistance to grassroots organizations that promote sustainable development, leadership and capacity building, income generating activities, provide education and health services, and advocate on behalf of vulnerable people. Operation USA rapidly and expertly provides on-the-ground aid by sending vital life-saving supplies and cash grants to assist communities in rebuilding. Partnering with grassroots organizations, Operation USA specializes in reaching vulnerable populations who are in the greatest need, yet who are often ignored by governments and larger aid organizations.</mission><charity_name>Operation USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Michael Mahdesian</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4268</orgid><administration_expenses>523072.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.033000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Los Angeles</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>90036</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.162000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>55.550000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.080000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>15151213.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.957000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>49.57</financial_score><street_address_1>7421 Beverly Blvd.</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Richard Walden</current_ceo_name><ein>953504080</ein><total_expenses>15827290.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.009000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>5692113.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>153005.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Disaster relief &amp; development since 1979</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.350000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4268/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
