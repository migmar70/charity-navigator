We offer our students college scholarships, caring volunteer mentors and hope for a better life. Our comprehensive services start in middle school, continue through high school and include their transition into college. We fund our college scholarships and student services through a unique public-private fund raising model, and our mentors generously volunteer their mentoring services to our children. TSIC's multi-year commitment to at-risk children throughout our state is also an investment in the communities in which our students live. Since our inception we have served over 16,000 children throughout 67 counties in Florida.</mission><charity_name>Take Stock in Children</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Richard A.
