Literacy Partners has provided hope and opportunity for adults who cannot read. We have provided free adult and family literacy programs to over 25,000 disadvantaged New Yorkers in our 35 years of service. We teach thousands of the 3.7 million adults who are functionally illiterate in New York City to learn to read. Through participation in our programs, adults become capable, committed, and able to enter the mainstream of society. Committed students see tangible differences in the quality of their life and the lives of their children.</mission><charity_name>Literacy Partners</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mark H.
