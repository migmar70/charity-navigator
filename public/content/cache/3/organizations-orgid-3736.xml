Located just south of Haifa in the Carmel Mountains, Yemin Orde is both a home and school environment. Programs and activities supported by FYO not only benefit the children of Yemin Orde but also graduates dispersed throughout Israel, and many disenfranchised groups for whom Yemin Orde provides outreach programming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yemin Orde Educational Initiatives extends the Yemin Orde philosophy and proven methdologies to other educational entities in Israel. Through this program, we are "educating educators" to implement the Village Way in educational communities around Israel. This comprehensive methodology is reenergizing veteran educators and providing younger educators with novel ideas and a consistent methodology. </mission><charity_name>Friends of Yemin Orde</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mike Frieze &amp; Charles Gwirtsman</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3736</orgid><administration_expenses>239659.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.025000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Rockville</city><cob_title>Co-Chairs</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20852</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.202000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>65.020000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.183000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>8797061.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.924000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>69.24</financial_score><street_address_1>12230 Wilkins Ave</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Karen Sallerson</current_ceo_name><ein>223090463</ein><total_expenses>9516038.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.050000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>22628716.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>479318.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Supporting Yemin Orde Wingate Youth Village for disadvantaged youth in Israel</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.240000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3736/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
