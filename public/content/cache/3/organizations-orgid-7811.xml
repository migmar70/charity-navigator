Christel House builds and operates high social-impact learning centers in impoverished neighborhoods, which provide: quality education, nutritious meals, regular health care, life skills training and character development, as well as parent and community outreach. Children are taught the importance of caring, sharing and making a difference. Christel House believes that academic learning must be complemented with character development, a positive self-image and a commitment to caring for others. As a result, the work of Christel House will be multiplied many times over.</mission><charity_name>Christel House International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Christel DeHann</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7811</orgid><administration_expenses>744371.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.110000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Indianapolis</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>46204</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.236000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>50.490000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Children's and Family Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.108000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>4991083.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.741000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>42.41</financial_score><street_address_1>10 West Market Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1990</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Christel DeHaan</current_ceo_name><ein>352051932</ein><total_expenses>6730020.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.147000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>38956516.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>994566.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Transforming lives</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>5.780000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7811/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
