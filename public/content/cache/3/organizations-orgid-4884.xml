We draw on the resources of the world's leading medical and academic institutions and on the lived experience of the world's poorest and sickest communities. At its root, our mission is both medical and moral. It is based on solidarity, rather than charity alone. When our patients are ill and have no access to care, our team of health professionals, scholars, and activists will do whatever it takes to make them well -- just as we would do if a member of our own families, or we ourselves, were ill.</mission><charity_name>Partners In Health</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Ophelia Dahl</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4884</orgid><administration_expenses>3066753.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.026000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Boston</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>02215</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.182000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>66.420000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.316000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>109469329.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.941000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>66.91</financial_score><street_address_1>888 Commonwealth Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>3rd Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Ophelia Dahl</current_ceo_name><ein>043567502</ein><total_expenses>116309528.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.032000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>61909837.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>3773446.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing a preferential option for the poor in healthcare</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.530000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4884/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
