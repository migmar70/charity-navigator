Our mission is to provide parent-centered services to young children with hearing loss locally and globally. JTC is the world's largest private provider of services to newborns and young children with-or at risk for-hearing loss. JTC is the only institution in Southern California to provide audiological, developmental and educational services for children with hearing loss from birth through age 5 and their parents. JTC also offers services to parents in all 50 states and more than 60 countries through distance education. JTC provides exclusively spoken-language programs so that hearing-impaired children become prepared for mainstream classrooms. JTC offers an accredited master's and credential program to help meet the national demand for auditory/oral teachers of the deaf. JTC serves 25,000 families per year.</mission><charity_name>John Tracy Clinic</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Michael Barker</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10170</orgid><administration_expenses>719777.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.148000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Los Angeles</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>90007</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.184000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>49.180000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Social Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.049000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>3831892.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.791000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>40.56</financial_score><street_address_1>806 West Adams Boulevard</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>J.
