Since its founding in 1983, our affiliate has been enabling working-class families to help themselves become homeowners. To date, over 800 families have been able to realize their dream of homeownership. As the seventh ranked Habitat affiliate in the U.S., Habitat Charlotte continues to stand at the forefront of national efforts to fight substandard housing. Some of our achievements include being the first affiliate: to have existing homeowners raise the capital and construct a home for another family, to construct a home in 24 hours, and to Blitz Build 22 homes in one week. Eclipsing the one million dollar tithe level in 2001, we have become the largest single affiliate supporter of Habitat's International mission.</mission><charity_name>Habitat for Humanity of Charlotte</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Bill Blue</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8678</orgid><administration_expenses>530610.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.046000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Charlotte</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>28211</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.061000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.070000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Community and Housing Development</cause><program_expenses_growth>0E-15</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>10408448.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.904000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>56.54</financial_score><street_address_1>3815 Latrobe Drive</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Bert Green</current_ceo_name><ein>561366233</ein><total_expenses>11512195.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.049000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>29875837.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>573137.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Building houses, building hope</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.590000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8678/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
