They wanted to raise funds for SMA research to cure the disease, and support all affected families. Back then, very little was known about Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Very little research was being conducted. No one knew the cause of the disease let alone how to find a treatment and a cure. Patients and families affected by SMA were on their own and had little hope. Today, FSMA has a different story to tell. Families of SMA has created hope for our community that did not exist in 1984. We have raised and funded over $50 million for SMA research. Our support comes from generous individual donations and numerous fundraising events held by volunteer families and our Chapters.</mission><charity_name>Families of Spinal Muscular Atrophy</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Paula Barrett</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12524</orgid><administration_expenses>227817.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.074000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Elk Grove Village</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>60007</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.230000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>46.150000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Diseases, Disorders, and Disciplines</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.263000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1989851.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.651000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>36.51</financial_score><street_address_1>925 Busse Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Kenneth Hobby</current_ceo_name><ein>363320440</ein><total_expenses>3056352.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.274000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>835674.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>838684.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Research.
