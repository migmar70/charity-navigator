IATP works with organizations around the world to analyze how global trade agreements impact domestic farm and food policies. Alongside a global coalition, IATP advocates for fair trade policies that promote strong health standards, labor and human rights, the environment and, most fundamentally, democratic institutions. IATP is developing alternative economic models that include clean sources of energy that would spur rural development, as well as monitoring the impact of genetically-engineered crops, and working to stop the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture and aquaculture.</mission><charity_name>Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Harriet Barlow</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8304</orgid><administration_expenses>328453.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.093000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Minneapolis</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>55404</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.113000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.380000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Advocacy and Civil Rights</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.016000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>2870159.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.820000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.84</financial_score><street_address_1>2105 First Avenue South</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jim Harkness</current_ceo_name><ein>363501938</ein><total_expenses>3499712.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.086000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>4531680.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>301100.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Where global and local meet sustainability</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.830000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8304/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
