We have helped distribute life-saving food, clothing, and medicine across the African continent. We have also supported the construction of orphanages, churches, schools and vocational training centers, drilled water wells to provide safe drinking water, and established agricultural projects. Practical, direct grassroots action is the main focus of ICF. We channel the Christian concern of Americans into street level impact in African villages, where logistics often frustrate traditional relief efforts. The secret ingredient is a trustworthy network of local, native missionary partners, who personally shepherd gifts of food, clothing, medicine, equipment and funds to the places children need them most.</mission><charity_name>International Children's Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Thomas Schilleman</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7004</orgid><administration_expenses>49084.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.001000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Neenah</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>54957</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.130000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>64.580000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>WI</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.132000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>41078110.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.986000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>62.34</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
