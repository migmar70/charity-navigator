Our members serve in businesses, community development, and other service capacities to help provide resources and knowledge through love and respect to those who are in need. We are actively recruiting new leaders and members to go to the Muslim world today, especially to those places where the love of Jesus is not yet known. Frontiers will also help prepare our members for service and actively engage them to succeed at the tasks they perform abroad.</mission><charity_name>Frontiers</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>B Routh</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4112</orgid><administration_expenses>1547548.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.061000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>Phoenix</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board                             </cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>85082</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.041000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>55.070000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>AZ</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.014000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>19365212.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.774000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>54.21</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
