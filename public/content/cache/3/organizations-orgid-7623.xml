Women begin in our Sponsorship Program where direct financial aid from a sponsor helps them deal with the immediate effects of war and conflict such as lack of food, water, medicine and other necessities. The next leg of the journey is the Renewing Women's Life Skills (ReneWLS) Program that provides them with rights awareness, leadership education and vocational and technical skills training. Women build upon existing skills and learn new ones in order to regain their strength, stability and stature on the path to becoming active citizens.</mission><charity_name>Women for Women International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Founder, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mary Zients</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7623</orgid><administration_expenses>2660380.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.097000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>Chair of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20008</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.126000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.710000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.160000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>19799151.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.722000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>57.22</financial_score><street_address_1>4455 Connecticut Avenue, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>67.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 200</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Zainab Salbi</current_ceo_name><ein>521838756</ein><total_expenses>27417656.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.180000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>17443333.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>4958125.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping women survivors of war rebuild their lives</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.630000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7623/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
