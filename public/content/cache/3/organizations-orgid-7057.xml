Our vision is to&#xD;
end the euthanasia of all healthy and treatable animals. We are an open admission shelter: all animals are accepted regardless of history. Whether sick or well, friendly or aggressive, no animal is turned away. This means we receive over 18,000 animals coming in each year by citizens unable or unwilling to care for them. Of these, most are dogs and cats, though we do accept other small pets such as guinea pigs, rabbits, ferrets, and birds. In addition to adoption and lost &amp; found services, we also provide public education programs, pet visits to nursing homes, and lost and found pet tracking.</mission><charity_name>Kansas Humane Society</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jon Newman</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7057</orgid><administration_expenses>370712.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.099000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Wichita</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>67219</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.030000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.990000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>KS</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.213000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>2749244.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.735000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>44.85</financial_score><street_address_1>3313 North Hillside Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Kim Janzen</current_ceo_name><ein>480554339</ein><total_expenses>3736524.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.165000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>10030107.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>616568.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Protecting pets since 1888</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.580000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7057/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
