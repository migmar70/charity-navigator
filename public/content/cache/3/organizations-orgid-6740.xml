For more than 40 years Riverkeeper has been New York's #1 clean water advocate. We have helped to establish globally recognized standards for waterway and watershed protection and serve as the model and mentor for the growing Waterkeeper movement that includes more than more than 180 Keeper programs across the country and around the globe. Riverkeeper is an independent, member-supported environmental organization founded on the premise that citizens themselves must roll up their sleeves to defend our waterways.</mission><charity_name>Riverkeeper</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Dr. Howard A.
