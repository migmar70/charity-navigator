We do this by enabling Christian nationals to meet the physical, educational, emotional and spiritual needs of these children. In every country of operation, VisionTrust meets children's' physical and nutritional needs by providing at least one daily meal, potable water, food supplements, and routine health assessments and emergency health care. Educational needs are met by school tuition assistance, tutoring at our after school learning centers and daycare programs.
