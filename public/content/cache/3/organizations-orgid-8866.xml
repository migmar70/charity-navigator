World Childhood Foundation wants to give all children the opportunity to develop into strong, secure and responsible human beings. Childhood was founded in 1999 by H.M. Queen Silvia of Sweden, who felt a compelling need to address the social, emotional and material poverty of children around the world. Over the last five years the organizations has grown to support more than 100 programs in 14 countries. The Foundation&#xC2;&#xB4;s offices are found in Stockholm/Sweden, Sao Paulo/Brazil, New York/USA and M&#xC3;&#xBC;nchen/Berlin Germany. The Childhood USA foundation follows the charter of the global foundation in Sweden in that it has as its primary focus to raise awareness of children at risk for abuse and exploitation, and to create an environment away from harm and neglect.</mission><charity_name>World Childhood Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Michael J.
