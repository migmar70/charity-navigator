Our mission is founded on the conviction that every family should have the opportunity to own a basic, decent home in which to live in dignity and safety. We partner with the community and families to create affordable housing and help develop responsible homeowners and successful neighborhoods. Since its inception Habitat Northwest Harris County (NWHC) has built more than 160 homes, providing housing for more than 650 individuals. As of 2011 Habitat NWHC has built 5 subdivisions: Carrell Manor, Cherie Cove, Lancaster, Hampton Place and Hamill Ranch.
