Our more than 70 schools and programs constitute Israel's only government-recognized network of religious Jewish education, incorporating academic and technological studies. These also include youth villages and facilities for children in foster care. At present, AMIT's more than 20,000 children come largely from impoverished and/or dysfunctional families; significant numbers are new Ethiopian and Russian immigrants, as well as young people of Sephardic backgrounds.</mission><charity_name>AMIT</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Ina Tropper</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3293</orgid><administration_expenses>841450.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.105000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10003    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.017000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.970000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.045000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>6593244.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.828000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>57.24</financial_score><street_address_1>817 Broadway</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Debbie Isaac</current_ceo_name><ein>135631502</ein><total_expenses>7962377.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.066000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>13040022.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>527683.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Building Israel.
