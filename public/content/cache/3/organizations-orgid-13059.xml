Family &amp; Children's Place mission is to strengthen our community through healing the trauma of abuse, violence and neglect and promoting safe, healthy and stable families through research based services. We envision a community where children and families are free from violence, abuse and neglect. We educate families to prevent abuse, respond to children on the very day abuse comes to light, treat victims to reduce damage to their lives, and take steps to protect children from further maltreatment.</mission><charity_name>Family &amp; Children's Place</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Anthony Disser</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>13059</orgid><administration_expenses>535434.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.080000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Louisville</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>40206</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.094000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>65.930000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>KY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Youth Development, Shelter, and Crisis Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.088000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>5645736.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.853000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>65.87</financial_score><street_address_1>2303 River Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 200</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Dan Fox</current_ceo_name><ein>610549561</ein><total_expenses>6615191.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.065000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>8125039.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>434021.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Building brighter futures</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.050000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/13059/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
