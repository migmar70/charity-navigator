Our goal is to assist each of our residents and guests toward independent living. The Bakersfield Rescue Mission serves men and women of all ages. The Mission faithfully serves 400 meals a day, every day. By providing free meals for the many people living outside the Mission, we enable them to pay their rent, keep their utilities turned on, and live independently in their own home or apartment. The Mission has outstanding educational programs. In recent years, roughly 140 people have earned their GEDs. The Mission provides real solutions to our city's most pressing problems. The true heartbeat of the Mission's work is based on God's love for all of us and our love for God and others.</mission><charity_name>Bakersfield Rescue Mission</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Bob Bell</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9803</orgid><administration_expenses>248204.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.099000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Bakersfield</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>93305</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.069000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.510000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Homeless Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.035000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1867702.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.751000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.87</financial_score><street_address_1>821 East 21st Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>48.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Carlos Baldovinos</current_ceo_name><ein>951890705</ein><total_expenses>2485836.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.148000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2997830.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>369930.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Where love is in action</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.200000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9803/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
