This is accomplished by establishing a base of operations and partnering with the poor being served. The services at each base are customized depending on the needs of the region. The common denominator is always health care and a transportation system, typically a small bush airplane. The tears of a mother in the remote jungle are the same as a mother's tears in the asphalt jungle of an American city. They need a way to access whatever health care is available and the guidance to advance those capabilities. The goal is to change the course of humanity towards peace and hope.</mission><charity_name>Wings of Hope</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Larry Lemke</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9524</orgid><administration_expenses>210823.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.095000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>St. Louis</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board                             </cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>63005</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.635000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>61.020000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MO</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.005000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1952303.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.883000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>59.42</financial_score><street_address_1>18370 Wings of Hope Boulevard</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Douglas Clements</current_ceo_name><ein>430909606</ein><total_expenses>2208856.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.020000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>15347223.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>45730.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Changing the course of humanity towards peace and hope</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>6.940000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9524/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
