Globus Relief is a major force for good, creating a reliable humanitarian supply chain that has provided over $200 million worth of soft medical goods, instrumentation, medical equipment and other health related products. From our inception, Globus Relief has sought to cooperate, rather than compete, with other charities. Corporate and Business partnerships allow us to redirect humanitarian resources to charity partners, enabling them to provide improved healthcare services more effectively, and leverage expenses so more can be accomplished. As a result, our mission has impacted over 100 countries worldwide, partnering with over 500 charities and servicing over 12,000 projects worldwide.</mission><charity_name>Globus Relief</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Dan Driggs</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3849</orgid><administration_expenses>270478.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.004000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Salt Lake City</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>84104    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.499000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.950000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>UT</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.418000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>66545085.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.994000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>69.94</financial_score><street_address_1>1775 West 1500 South</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Ashley Robinson</current_ceo_name><ein>841369453</ein><total_expenses>66938440.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.001000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>29432249.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>122877.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Partnering to provide life saving resources to people in need</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.430000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3849/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
