NA'AMAT, a Hebrew acronym for "Movement of Working Women and Volunteers," is an organization and a movement striving to enhance the quality of life for women, children and families in Israel, the U.S. and around the world. NA'AMAT women act locally, nationally and globally in 11 countries. We are united in belief and in action around issues ranging from religious pluralism to an improvement in the status of women at home and in the workplace, from child well-being to peace in the Middle East, from the ability of single parents and new immigrants to build a life for themselves, to the end of domestic violence. We help women, and we help women help themselves.</mission><charity_name>NA'AMAT USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>National President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Elizabeth Raider</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6033</orgid><administration_expenses>230780.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.118000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>National President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>0</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10018</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.095000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>37.280000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.007000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>1637706.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.839000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>50.59</financial_score><street_address_1>505 Eighth Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>28.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 2302</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Elizabeth Raider</current_ceo_name><ein>135590516</ein><total_expenses>1949745.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.041000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>5151038.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>81259.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>A Voice for Women and Children - A Voice for Israel</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.640000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6033/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
