From 46 Israeli, Palestinian and Egyptian teenagers in 1993, we still focus on the Middle East but have expanded our programming to include young leaders from South Asia, Cyprus and the Balkans. Its leadership network now encompasses over 4,000 young people from several conflict regions. The Seeds of Peace internationally recognized program model begins at the International Camp in Maine and continues through follow-up programming with international youth conferences, regional workshops, educational and professional opportunities, and an adult educator program.</mission><charity_name>Seeds of Peace</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Richard Berman</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4459</orgid><administration_expenses>880574.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.187000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board                             </cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10017    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.024000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>48.650000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.084000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>3199797.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.682000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>39.82</financial_score><street_address_1>370 Lexington Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 2103</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Leslie Adelson Lewin</current_ceo_name><ein>521814447</ein><total_expenses>4688737.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.129000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1660691.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>608366.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Empowering leaders of the next generation since 1993</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.280000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4459/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
