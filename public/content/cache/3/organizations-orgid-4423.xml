Since 1970, Samaritan's Purse has helped meet needs of people who are victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease, and famine with the purpose of sharing God's love through His Son, Jesus Christ. Emergency relief meets desperate needs of victims worldwide. Operation Christmas Child delivers more than 8 million shoebox gifts to poor children in more than 100 countries each year. World Medical Mission sends doctors, equipment, and supplies to underprivileged countries. Community development and vocational programs in impoverished villages and neighborhoods help people break the cycle of poverty and give them hope for a better tomorrow. Vulnerable children are rescued, educated, fed, clothed, and sheltered, letting them know that God loves them, Jesus died and rose again for them, and they are not forgotten.</mission><charity_name>Samaritan's Purse</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Franklin Graham</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4423</orgid><administration_expenses>17136371.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.051000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Boone</city><cob_title>Board Chairman and President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>28607    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.109000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.910000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>0</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.060000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>296779417.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.883000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>62.38</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
