Founded in 1982, we have been dedicating our energies to redirect federal budget priorities away from the military and toward human needs. Our goals are to: challenge and promote alternatives to militarism and violence as the solution to conflict; shift from a military to a civilian-based economy to address the threats to our real security; clean up environmental effects of nuclear weapons production as well as toxic waste at all military facilities; eliminate the testing, production, sale and use of weapons of mass destruction; prevent violence against women; and increase women's political leadership to further WAND's goals.</mission><charity_name>WAND Education Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Sen.
