Abraham House offers the incarcerated and their relatives a place of hope and community, where lives can be rebuilt, families mended, lessons learned, and men, women and children deeply marked by crime can receive the spiritual, social and practical tools to become productive citizens. Although founded by a French worker priest and Belgian nuns, the program is non-denominational and open to all. The minimum requirement is to be a human being, to be able to relate to others and to have a capacity for trust.</mission><charity_name>Abraham House</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Robert J.
