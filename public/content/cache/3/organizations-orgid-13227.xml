Each year we collect roughly 6,000 used bicycles and tons of used parts from our supporters around Greater Boston and New England.&#xD;
We ship most of these bikes overseas to economic development projects through our International Programs in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Bikes that don't get shipped often land in our Youth Programs where teens learn bicycle safety and mechanics skills in the process of earning bikes to keep for themselves.&#xD;
Our retail Bike Shop also reconditions and sells some of the donated bikes that we receive, employing many graduates of our programs. The Shop's profit from the bicycle sales, parts sales, and repairs goes towards funding our youth and international work.</mission><charity_name>Bikes not Bombs</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Scott Thompson</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>13227</orgid><administration_expenses>146337.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.115000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Jamaica Plain</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>02130</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.121000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>49.220000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>0</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.009000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1044716.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.823000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>51.73</financial_score><street_address_1>284 Amory Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>47.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jodie Sugarman-Brozan</current_ceo_name><ein>043138753</ein><total_expenses>1267892.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.060000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>512562.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>76839.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Using the bicycle as a vehicle for social change</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.400000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/13227/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
