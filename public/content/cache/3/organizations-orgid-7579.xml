In the fall of 1985, a group of Guatemalans asked the Huebsch family of Minnesota, USA for help in educating their children. As a result, Common Hope was founded so that friends could get involved. Since then, Common Hope has grown from a small, family-based project to a powerful force partnering with over 8,000 children and adults living in rural and urban poverty in Guatemala.</mission><charity_name>Common Hope</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Bill Huebsch</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7579</orgid><administration_expenses>330599.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.098000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>St. Paul</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>55114</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.008000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>61.530000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.023000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2755347.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.822000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>58.03</financial_score><street_address_1>550 Vandalia Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Shari Blindt</current_ceo_name><ein>411560297</ein><total_expenses>3351726.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.079000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>5812024.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>265780.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Educating children, empowering families</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.730000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7579/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
