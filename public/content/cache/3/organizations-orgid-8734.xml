The Foundation adopts the entire first grade in an inner city school in first grade. These Dreamers are provided with year-round academic enrichment through after school and summer programs, focusing on literacy and mathematics, as well as social, cultural and recreational programming. We also provide mentoring and tutoring by volunteers, college and SAT preparation courses, and tuition assistance for Dreamers that will attend college or vocational school.</mission><charity_name>I Have A Dream Foundation - Los Angeles</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Grant F.
