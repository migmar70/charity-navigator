Today, SOME is an interfaith, community-based organization that exists to help the poor and homeless of our nation's capital. We meet the immediate daily needs of the people we serve with food, clothing, and health care. We help break the cycle of homelessness by offering services, such as affordable housing, job training, addiction treatment, and counseling, to the poor, the elderly and individuals with mental illness. Each day, SOME is restoring hope and dignity one person at a time. We invite you to join us.</mission><charity_name>SOME</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Linda Jo Smith</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6077</orgid><administration_expenses>609790.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.035000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>Chairperson</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20001</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.084000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>66.480000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Homeless Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.062000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>15095552.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.882000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>65.03</financial_score><street_address_1>71 'O' Street, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Richard Gerlach</current_ceo_name><ein>237098123</ein><total_expenses>17113853.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.082000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>38902821.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1408511.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Restoring hope and dignity one person at a time</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.270000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6077/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
