The mission of Christian Relief Services is to work through partnerships and in collaboration with grassroots charitable organizations to connect the vast resources of the United States with communities in need to enable the people of these communities to help themselves. Through partnerships with local, non-governmental organizations and our affiliates, we provide donations of food, medical supplies, hygiene items, school supplies and building materials to hospitals, clinics, schools, orphanages and refugee camps in several African countries.</mission><charity_name>Christian Relief Services Charities</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>James O'Brien</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7653</orgid><administration_expenses>1809744.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.045000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Alexandria</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>22303</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.073000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>49.400000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>VA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Multipurpose Human Service Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.028000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>33652194.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.853000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>41.03</financial_score><street_address_1>2550 Huntington Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>67.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 200</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Bryan Krizek</current_ceo_name><ein>911937903</ein><total_expenses>39415896.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.100000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>42539071.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>3953958.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>A gentle voice for good</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.650000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7653/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
