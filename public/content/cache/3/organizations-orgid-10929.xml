Its purpose is to assist law enforcement officers, who retired as a result of a disabling injury, adjust to, and cope with, the many difficulties associated with an untimely and unplanned ending to their careers and chosen way of life. Feelings of loss, separation anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress disorder are often experienced. The DPOCC has made its services available to active police officers and members of their families. It is the DPOCC's mission, that through its counseling services and other programs, the quality of life for this group of public servants, will be greatly enhanced.</mission><charity_name>Disabled Police Officers Counseling Center</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Terry K.
