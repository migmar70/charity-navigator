Providing access to critical developmental programs is a priority for the TWF. Youth are encouraged to explore their interests and career aspirations in an inspiring and supportive environment at the Tiger Woods Learning Center. Achieving goals and reaching dreams is the focus of our nationwide character development program. The Foundation is giving youth the skills to lay their own groundwork for the future. We can proudly say that more than ten million young people have benefited from the TWF since its inception.</mission><charity_name>Tiger Woods Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Michael McKee</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8100</orgid><administration_expenses>680955.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.085000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Irvine</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>92617</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.084000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>58.800000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Youth Development, Shelter, and Crisis Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.110000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>6850688.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.861000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>58.61</financial_score><street_address_1>121 Innovation Drive</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 150</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Gregory McLaughlin</current_ceo_name><ein>061468499</ein><total_expenses>7952355.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.052000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>50823123.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>420712.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Empowering young people to reach their highest potential</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>6.390000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8100/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
