We believe that ending slavery is an ambitious, and realizable, goal. Free the Slaves liberates slaves around the world, helps them rebuild their lives and researches real world solutions to eradicate slavery forever. We use world class research and compelling stories from the frontlines of slavery to convince the powerful and the powerless that we can end slavery. Free the Slaves works on the ground with liberators around the world. We do what it takes to free men, women and children and help them stay free. Basic needs for food, shelter and safety from angry slave owners must be met. Then the system that allows slavery to flourish has to be dismantled and another created by former slaves learning to live in freedom.</mission><charity_name>Free the Slaves</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Stephen Maher</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>11051</orgid><administration_expenses>262403.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.082000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>Board Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20036</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.265000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>64.470000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.243000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2635483.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.829000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>63.29</financial_score><street_address_1>1320 19th Street, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 600</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Indika Samarawickreme</current_ceo_name><ein>562189635</ein><total_expenses>3175781.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.087000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1193980.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>277895.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Working to end slavery worldwide</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.370000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/11051/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
