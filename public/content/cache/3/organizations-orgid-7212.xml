The Children's Museum of Atlanta is to spark imagination and inspire discovery and learning for all children through the power of play. Atlanta's only children's museum, Imagine It! is the perfect place for children age eight and under and their families to learn and explore together in a safe and fun hands-on environment. Our open and interactive area is filled with unique, entertaining and educational areas to explore. Our programming offers children the opportunity to use all of their senses in a unique and interactive way, while developing their knowledge and understanding of reading, social studies, math, science, language arts and the arts. We are a community resource for children, parents, caregivers, families and schools. We are deeply committed to the importance of play and its importance to the development and lives of all children.</mission><charity_name>Imagine It!
