Over the years, the Museum's holdings have grown to encompass a distinguished collection of American art from the nineteenth century to the present, with a particular focus on the art and artists of Long Island's East End, and includes paintings by American Impressionist William Merritt Chase and works by the pre-eminent 20th-century realist Fairfield Porter. Today the collection includes the work of many of the most important artists who have lived and worked in the region, as well as those who are currently part of the dynamic art scene. Additionally, the museum features changing exhibitions throughout the year. A new and greatly expanded facility, designed by the internationally renowned firm of Herzog &amp; de Meuron, will enable The Parrish's growing collection to be on view year round.</mission><charity_name>The Parrish Art Museum</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Carlo Bronzini Vender, Douglas Polley</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6697</orgid><administration_expenses>467638.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.148000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>Southampton</city><cob_title>Co-Chairs</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>11968</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.008000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>44.900000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>0</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Museums</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.096000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1396503.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.442000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>39.42</financial_score><street_address_1>25 Job's Lane</street_address_1><accountability_score>52.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Terrie Sultan</current_ceo_name><ein>111782495</ein><total_expenses>3154812.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.409000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>33053881.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1290671.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Encouraging and cultivating an appreciation of art</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>9.290000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>0</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6697/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
