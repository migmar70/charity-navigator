YL is a Christian ministry that reaches out to middle school, high school and college-aged kids. Our approach is relational. We go where kids are in order to build friendships with them and earn the right to make a positive impact on their lives. We want them to know that they are loved and valued. YL is working with teens in more than 800 communities across the United States and in more than 50 countries.</mission><charity_name>Young Life</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Curtis B.
