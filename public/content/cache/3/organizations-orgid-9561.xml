We do this by creating and managing prizes that drive innovators to solve some of the greatest challenges facing the world today. The X PRIZE is viewed as the leading model to leverage the elements of public interest, entrepreneurial spirit and cross-disciplinary innovation to bring about breakthroughs that benefit us all. An X PRIZE is a $10 million+ award given to the first team to achieve a specific goal, set by the X PRIZE Foundation, which has the potential to benefit humanity. The X PRIZE Foundation continues to unveil new X PRIZEs in exploration (space and underwater), life sciences, energy and environment, education and global development.</mission><charity_name>X PRIZE Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chairman and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Peter H.
