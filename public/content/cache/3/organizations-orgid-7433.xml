Since its founding in 1979, PRI has remained steadfast to the vision of a free and civil society where individuals can achieve their full potential. Put simply, public policy is too important to be left just to the experts. Individuals are the real decision makers when it comes to their schools, health care, and environment. PRI reinforces this ideal by providing you with the information, inspiration, and opportunity to make decisions about the daily issues that matter most to you. The Institute's activities include publications, events, media commentary, legislative testimony, and community outreach.</mission><charity_name>Pacific Research Institute</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Clark S.
