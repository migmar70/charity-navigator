The Valerie Fund's mission is to provide support for the comprehensive health care of children with cancer and blood disorders. Today there are seven Valerie Fund Children's Centers for Cancer and Blood Disorders located in major hospitals in the tri-state area, providing caring and comprehensive health care to more than 5,000 children and their families each year. We bring state-of-the-art treatment centers close to the home, provide counseling and child development activities, make a summer camp experience that creates a one week miracle for children with cancer, and do thousands of other things large and small that collectively make a difference.</mission><charity_name>The Valerie Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Merrie Bernstein</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8797</orgid><administration_expenses>207490.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.098000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Maplewood</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>07040</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.103000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>54.730000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NJ</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Patient and Family Support</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.041000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1667477.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.788000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>54.48</financial_score><street_address_1>2101 Millburn Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>55.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Barry Kirschner</current_ceo_name><ein>222126867</ein><total_expenses>2114859.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.113000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2771464.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>239892.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Supporting comprehensive health care services for children with cancer and blood disorders</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.850000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8797/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
