We help individual animals in distress and win policy changes that provide long-term protections. &#xD;
&#xD;
Founded in 1969, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) works to improve the welfare of wild and domestic animals throughout the world by reducing commercial exploitation of animals, protecting wildlife habitats, and assisting animals in distress. We seek to motivate the public to prevent cruelty to animals and to promote animal welfare and conservation policies that advance the well-being of both animals and people. &#xD;

IFAW is an international organization and this site only includes financial information for IFAW's US entity.
