In its 30+ years of existence, it has grown from the single retail store where home crafters could sell their goods into a small community offering jobs, food, education, temporary shelter and home ownership to people and families in need. H.O.M.E. has seen from its beginning days that although the ownership of a home is of fundamental importance to a family, other services are needed to ensure family stability and foster self-esteem. In response to these needs, its activities have grown to include: five shelters, a foodbank soup kitchen, recovery barn and thrift store, Abby's Attic, and desktop publishing.</mission><charity_name>H.O.M.E.</charity_name><current_ceo_title></current_ceo_title><cob_name>Millie Grimes</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10262</orgid><administration_expenses>302785.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.209000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Orland </city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>04472</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.045000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>37.210000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>0</loanstoofficers><state>ME</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Community and Housing Development</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.076000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>1109014.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.766000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>58.85</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
