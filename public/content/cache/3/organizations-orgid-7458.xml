The Alliance recognizes that indigenous people are the rainforests' natural custodians, and therefore, key strategies of the alliance focus on strengthening their culture and empowering their ability to stand for and represent their own interests. The Pachamama Alliance's mission is two-fold: to preserve the Earth's tropical rainforests by empowering the indigenous people who are its natural custodians; and to contribute to the creation of a new global vision of equity and sustainability for all.</mission><charity_name>The Pachamama Alliance</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7458</orgid><administration_expenses>262961.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.083000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Environment</category><city>San Francisco</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94129</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.216000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.090000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Environmental Protection and Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.177000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2425729.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.774000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.24</financial_score><street_address_1>The Presidio Building 1009, Gound Floor</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>P.O.
