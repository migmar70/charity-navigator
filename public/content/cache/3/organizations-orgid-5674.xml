They had a common vision to "disciple the nations to reach the world." Currently over 80 WIM missionaries work in 25 nations around the world. World Indigenous Missions is an independent missionary-sending organization. We offer short term mission trips, internships and careers in missions. WIM has three targets which help accomplish our mission. They are evangelizing the lost with the gospel of Jesus Christ, establishing indigenous churches where there were previously none, and equipping indigenous believers to spread the gospel and become church leaders.</mission><charity_name>World Indigenous Missions</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5674</orgid><administration_expenses>198474.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.115000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>New Braunfels</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>78131</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.044000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>49.220000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.013000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1474418.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.855000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>51.72</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
