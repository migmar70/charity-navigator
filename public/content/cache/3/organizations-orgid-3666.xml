We accomplish this through recruiting, training and sending men and women from the U.S. and Canada to meet the ever-growing demand for quality English education in Asia. While ELIC is focused primarily on university campuses, we believe that we also have a stake in what happens beyond the campus. We currently have 534 teachers and family members in Asia, and have sent 10,000 throughout the history of our organization.</mission><charity_name>English Language Institute/China</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Phillip Hubbard</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3666</orgid><administration_expenses>1287505.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.087000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Fort Collins</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>80524</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.052000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>43.290000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CO</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>International Peace, Security, and Affairs</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.022000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>12338066.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.837000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>42.61</financial_score><street_address_1>1629 Blue Spruce Drive</street_address_1><accountability_score>44.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Tim Davis</current_ceo_name><ein>953551085</ein><total_expenses>14724211.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.074000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1951944.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1098640.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing teams to teach English as a foreign language</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.130000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>0</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3666/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
