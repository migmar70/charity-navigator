The words "Ohr Torah" literally mean "the Torah is light," and refer to the enlightening beacon which radiates from a true combination of Torah values, Zionist ideals, and a dedication to tikkun olam. Indeed, since its founding, OTS has emerged as this guiding light, charting new educational, legal and social paths to groundbreaking change in the realms of women's rights within Judaism, relations between observant and secular Jews, and the role of the worldwide community educator and spiritual leader. OTS has now grown into an all-encompassing network, enlightening and motivating nearly 3,000 men and women.</mission><charity_name>Ohr Torah Stone Colleges and Graduate Programs</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chancellor</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Fred Ehrman</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4258</orgid><administration_expenses>199197.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>0</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.037000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>0</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10036    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.040000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>36.100000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.073000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>4762680.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.908000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>56.50</financial_score><street_address_1>49 West 45th Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>24.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 701</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Shlomo Riskin</current_ceo_name><ein>133275531</ein><total_expenses>5243768.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.053000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>569580.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>281891.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Lighting the way in Jewish learning, leading the way in Jewish living</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.050000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4258/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
