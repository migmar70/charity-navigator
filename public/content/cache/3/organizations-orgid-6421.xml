The main objective of the PCRF is to identify and treat every child in the Middle East in need of specialized surgery not available to them locally. We locate, sponsor and run volunteer medical missions to the Middle East in adult and pediatric cardiac surgery, pediatric cardiology, plastic and reconstructive surgery, maxillofacial surgery, pediatric urology, ophthalmology, vascular surgery, pediatric orthopedic surgery, occupational therapy, and other specialties. Since our founding, over 800 children have been, or currently are being treated, outside of the Middle East through the PCRF.</mission><charity_name>Palestine Children's Relief Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Dr. Musa Nasir</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6421</orgid><administration_expenses>61419.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.048000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Kent</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>44240</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.023000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>65.020000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>OH</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.231000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1178221.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.928000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>69.28</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
