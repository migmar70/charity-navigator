Children attend meetings and practices after school, with games on Saturdays. Equipment, rules and field sizes are adjusted to give each group a positive experience. A member of KYL learns teamwork, loyalty and sportsmanship, both on and off the field. Leaders take their boys and girls on outings that range from simple gatherings for pizza and group games to trips to Disneyland. Some of the most memorable times are experienced when children attend summer and winter camps at Mount Kare, our beautiful 14-acre resident camp in the Angeles National Forest.</mission><charity_name>Kare Youth League</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Francis E.
