MPBN connects the people of Maine to each other and to the world through the open exchange of information, ideas and cultural content. As Maine's premier, independent media resource, we create exceptional opportunities for the communities we serve to engage with critical issues, compelling stories and quality entertainment. Through its radio, television, educational and Web services, the Maine Public Broadcasting Network provides ideas, information and lifelong learning to a diverse public. The majority of these services are available to everyone at no charge. Hundreds of thousands of people find value in MPBN's services every day.</mission><charity_name>Maine Public Broadcasting Network</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Henry Schmelzer</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4037</orgid><administration_expenses>1367677.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.124000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Arts, Culture, Humanities</category><city>Lewiston</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>04240    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.004000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>55.720000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>ME</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Public Broadcasting and Media</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.064000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>7621992.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.692000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>50.21</financial_score><street_address_1>1450 Lisbon Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Mark Vogelzang</current_ceo_name><ein>223171529</ein><total_expenses>11012211.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.183000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>16232586.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>2022542.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Connecting the people of Maine to each other and to the world</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.450000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4037/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
