Kolel's activities include the "Chalukah", which is the distribution of quarterly stipends to families that can not make ends meet. This past Pesach, the Kolel distributed approximately $850,000 to over 4,000 families consisting of a total of over 16,000 persons. In addition, Kolel helps to pay for the expenses of a wedding, the birth of a baby, or to help cover medical expenses. Kolel operations also include three dental clinics, used by over 5,000 people annually for full range dental treatment, as well as a subsidized clothing store.</mission><charity_name>Kolel Chibas Jerusalem</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9380</orgid><administration_expenses>337920.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>1</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.133000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Brooklyn</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>11219</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.041000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>31.250000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.023000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>1</overall_rating><program_expenses>1533525.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.605000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>38.73</financial_score><street_address_1>4802-A Twelfth Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>25.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Berish Rubin</current_ceo_name><ein>135655181</ein><total_expenses>2531813.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>1</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.260000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>90607.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>660368.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Reaching thousands with the Mitzvah of charity</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.030000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9380/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
