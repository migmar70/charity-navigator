The Food Bank provides food to over 200,000 people in San Francisco and Marin counties each week. We will distribute 43.5 million pounds of food to the community this year, enough to feed 93,000 meals every day. Did you know that effective 1/1/11 the San Francisco Food Bank and Marin Food Bank have merged to create a combined organization to accomplish the goal of feeding more people at risk of hunger in Marin? If you have any questions about this change or any other work that the Food Bank does, please call 415-282-1900.</mission><charity_name>San Francisco Food Bank</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Shari Freedman</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4430</orgid><administration_expenses>608260.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.007000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>San Francisco</city><cob_title>Chairperson</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94107    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.150000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.780000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.161000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>73806469.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.969000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>69.69</financial_score><street_address_1>900 Pennsylvania Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Paul Ash</current_ceo_name><ein>943041517</ein><total_expenses>76158067.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.022000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>20357053.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1743338.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Our mission is to end hunger in San Francisco and Marin.
