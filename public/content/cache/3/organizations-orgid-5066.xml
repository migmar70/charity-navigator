Christopher also formed his own foundation, but in 1999, the two came together as the Christopher Reeve Foundation. &lt;br&gt;Today, the Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation is recognized as the premier spinal cord injury research organization in the world. Through 30 years of scientific progress made possible by the Reeve Foundation, neuroscientists everywhere now agree that repairing the damaged spinal cord is not a question of "if," but a question of "when." The Reeve Foundation also provides many programs and services that empower those living with paralysis with knowledge, resources, support, and community.</mission><charity_name>Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>John M.
