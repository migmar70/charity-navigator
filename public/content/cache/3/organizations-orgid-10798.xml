(Helping Other People Excel) Farm, Inc. is to provide at-risk boys an opportunity to know Jesus Christ and develop life skills consistent with Biblical truths. Founded in 1990, H.O.P.E. Farm targets boys from single-parent homes who lack a positive male influence in their lives. The youth enter the program between the ages of five and seven and typically stay through high school. We provide a variety of activities for the boys that address spirit, mind and body. We work daily with each child's mother and teacher in order to maintain accountability throughout the day. Recognizing the importance of a collective effort, H.O.P.E. Farm has built P.I.P. (Parent Involvement Program). P.I.P. assists the parents of H.O.P.E. Farm boys with spiritual, inspirational encouragement and provides structural tools to help them partner with H.O.P.E Farm.</mission><charity_name>H.O.P.E.
