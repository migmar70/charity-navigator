We are committed to locating missing children through active casework investigation, assisting law enforcement agencies, and preventing child abduction through education and public awareness. Regardless of the duration of the search process, we are dedicated to providing practical help, technical support, and advocacy to the victim families or legal guardians of missing children. Since 1984, our resolve has been to remain involved throughout the duration of a case until the child is recovered and not close a case until authorized by law enforcement or the searching family.</mission><charity_name>Operation Lookout</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mike Gibson</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9190</orgid><administration_expenses>60797.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>0</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.045000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Everett</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>98203</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.120000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>9.980000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>0</loanstoofficers><state>WA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Advocacy and Civil Rights</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.320000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>0</overall_rating><program_expenses>132638.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.098000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>0.00</financial_score><street_address_1>6320 Evergreen Way</street_address_1><accountability_score>22.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 201</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Melody Gibson</current_ceo_name><ein>911298249</ein><total_expenses>1341541.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>0</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.855000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>-85716.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1148106.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Every missing child deserves the chance to be found</tag_line><independentaudit>0</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>-0.060000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>0</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9190/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
