CCF will work with all stakeholders to develop best practices in research, education, and land use to benefit all species, including people. While CCF's main headquarters are in Namibia -- the country with the largest number of wild cheetah, its reach and vision are worldwide. CCF has close links and assists in training and sharing program successes with other countries where cheetah live. CCF's international program includes distributing CCF materials, lending resources and support, and providing training through Africa and the rest of the world. Efforts are currently underway to develop new conservation programs or support existing cheetah conservation efforts.</mission><charity_name>Cheetah Conservation Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Dr. Stephen J.
