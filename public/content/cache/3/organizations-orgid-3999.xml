Life dedicates itself to alleviating human suffering around the world regardless of race, color, religion, or cultural background. Our global organization strives to offer a variety of humanitarian, health, and educational services and programs to aid refugees and victims of war, natural or man-made disasters. Since its founding, Life has provided over $200 million in humanitarian assistance to more than 50 million beneficiaries worldwide. Our programs started with providing basic emergency assistance to victims of war, manmade and natural disasters, then expanded to cover health, nutrition, education, social, community development, human development, water and sanitation.</mission><charity_name>Life for Relief and Development</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Abdulwahab Asamarai</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3999</orgid><administration_expenses>1094926.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.027000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Southfield</city><cob_title>Board Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>48075    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.304000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.040000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MI</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.324000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>37793804.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.959000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>64.59</financial_score><street_address_1>17300 West Ten Mile Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>57.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Mujahid Al-Fayadh</current_ceo_name><ein>954402149</ein><total_expenses>39402523.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.013000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>4133518.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>513793.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Where there is LIFE, there is hope</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.100000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3999/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
