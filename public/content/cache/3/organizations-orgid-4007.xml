ProLiteracy champions the power of literacy to improve the lives of adults and their families, communities, and societies. ProLiteracy helps build the capacity and quality of programs that are teaching adults to read, write, compute, use technology, and learn English as a new language. We do this by: advocating for public policies; providing professional development and training, technical assistance, and online resources for those working with adult learners; publishing educational materials; and sponsoring an annual conference focusing on adult literacy instruction.</mission><charity_name>ProLiteracy Worldwide</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Kevin J.
