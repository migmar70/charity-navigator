CLC's founder, Dr. Hal Hadden, is convinced of two things concerning Christian men: 1) Men want to be equipped to lead in order to make an impact for God. 2) Men want to develop some close relationships with other men that go far deeper than most of their day to day acquaintances. Considering these needs, CLC has put together a two-year program that challenges men to grow in their faith and experience the journey of standing together with other men as they learn to lead together.</mission><charity_name>Christian Leadership Concepts</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7254</orgid><administration_expenses>263281.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.216000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>Brentwood</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>37024</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.004000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>52.860000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TN</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.072000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>787402.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.647000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>54.95</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
