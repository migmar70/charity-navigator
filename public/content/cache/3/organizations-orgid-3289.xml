Since its founding in 1982, the nonprofit global health and disaster relief organization has delivered more than $10 billion in aid to 164 countries. AmeriCares is able to maximize the impact of each donation due to its gift-in-kind model and the contributions received from pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturers, as well as our partnerships with local health care providers around the world. Historically, for every $100 donated, AmeriCares is able to deliver up to $2,500 in humanitarian relief to people in need, including medicines, medical supplies, nutritional supplements and other vital aid.</mission><charity_name>AmeriCares</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>C.
