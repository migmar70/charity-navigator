Our area of excellence and great strength is our deep understanding of children's experiences of deprivation, exclusion and vulnerability, and our dedication to placing those experiences at the center of our policy and practice. We work to reduce the roots of poverty by: giving a voice to deprived, excluded and vulnerable children and youth and implementing child development, protection and emergency assistance programs through local communities.</mission><charity_name>ChildFund International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Maureen Denlea Massey</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>3499</orgid><administration_expenses>16075222.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.074000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Richmond</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>23294    </zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.020000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.210000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>VA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0E-15</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>176858527.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.818000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.26</financial_score><street_address_1>2821 Emerywood Parkway</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Anne Lynam Goddard</current_ceo_name><ein>540536100</ein><total_expenses>216184138.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.107000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>80864529.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>23250389.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>We help vulnerable children along life's journey</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.290000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/3499/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
