Since then, the mission has grown to a 6 acre campus, with programs for men, women, and families and a free primary care clinic. We are a local united Christian organization and ministry dedicated to providing love, hope, respect, and a new beginning to the homeless. Because lasting life change is not possible without a change of heart, we stress the importance of holistic care, including physical, emotional, educational and spiritual needs. We will serve over 240,000 meals and provide service to more than 75% of the homeless population of Tarrant County this year. Working in collaboration with many local agencies and organizations, we facilitate access to services and benefits available in the community to augment and compliment Mission programs.</mission><charity_name>Union Gospel Mission of Tarrant County</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Fred Closuit</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4596</orgid><administration_expenses>160149.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.039000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Fort Worth</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>76102</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.036000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>54.570000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>TX</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Homeless Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.068000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3052619.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.757000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>48.56</financial_score><street_address_1> 1321 East Lancaster Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Don Shisler</current_ceo_name><ein>756054677</ein><total_expenses>4031137.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.203000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>13860066.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>818369.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>God's healthy place to end homelessness, one person at a time.</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>3.410000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/4596/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
