While wild turkey restoration is nearing completion, the NWTF still has much work to do. Across North America, supporters are working to enhance habitat for wild turkeys and other wildlife while providing hunters with more opportunities and access to public and private land. In addition, NWTF volunteers and partners are introducing youth, women and people with disabilities to the outdoors through special educational events.</mission><charity_name>National Wild Turkey Federation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jim Hinkle</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>4201</orgid><administration_expenses>3104003.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.090000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Edgefield</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>29824</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.052000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>52.580000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>SC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Wildlife Conservation</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.082000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>30553138.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.888000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>46.38</financial_score><street_address_1>770 Augusta Road</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>George C.
