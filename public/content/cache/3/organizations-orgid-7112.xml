The mission is accomplished by: disseminating educational information; distributing support materials that ease the burden of those affected by the diseases; and by increasing public awareness. The National Caregiving Foundation focuses its efforts on the Alzheimer's Project. The Alzheimer's Project is a national effort to assist caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative disease that attacks the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking and behavior. Alzheimer's not only attacks the affected person, but also the caregivers who pay a high physical and emotional price for their association with their loved one who falls victim to the disease.</mission><charity_name>National Caregiving Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name></cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7112</orgid><administration_expenses>295680.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>0</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.122000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Alexandria</city><cob_title></cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>22314</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.051000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>6.610000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>VA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Patient and Family Support</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.042000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>0</overall_rating><program_expenses>423828.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.175000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>0</boardlist_status><financial_score>0.00</financial_score><street_address_1>801 North Pitt Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>14.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 116</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Joseph Salta</current_ceo_name><ein>521422395</ein><total_expenses>2412553.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>0</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.701000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>406474.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1693045.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>A world of care</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.160000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7112/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
