Yad Sarah's mission is to keep the ill and the elderly in their homes and out of institutions as long as possible. Yad Sarah's best-known service is the lending of medical and rehabilitative equipment on a short-term basis free of charge to anyone who needs it - from a stock over 250,000 items, from crutches and wheelchairs to oxygen concentrators and electronic monitors. We also provide services including: transportation and day care centers for the disabled, drop-in centers and minimum-charge dental clinics for the elderly, personal computerized emergency alarms, and guidance/exhibition centers which help disabled people choose assistive devices.</mission><charity_name>Friends of Yad Sarah</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jay Pomrenze</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10665</orgid><administration_expenses>52753.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.025000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10022</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.022000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>46.010000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>0</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.040000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>1816201.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.893000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>54.16</financial_score><street_address_1>450 Park Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>40.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>7th Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Adele Goldberg</current_ceo_name><ein>133106175</ein><total_expenses>2031776.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.080000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>0</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1687010.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>162822.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing medical services to the needy</tag_line><independentaudit>2</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.830000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10665/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
