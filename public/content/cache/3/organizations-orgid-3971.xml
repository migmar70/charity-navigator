(Kids in Distressed Situations) was founded in 1985 to assist children suffering from famine in Ethiopia. From the initial efforts of a small group of children's industry leaders, the organization has grown into a global charity dedicated to alleviating poverty conditions among children and assisting in relief efforts following major disasters. K.I.D.S. brings hope and self-esteem to children in need and their families by providing new clothes, shoes, toys, furniture, books and juvenile products through a network of more than a thousand local social service agencies. These agencies serve youth in poverty-stricken communities through homeless shelters, foster-care facilities, hospitals, relief organizations, food banks and other programs in the U.S. and abroad.</mission><charity_name>K.I.D.S.</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Kevin M.
