We foster the communion of Ukrainian Americans with the Ukrainian nation and of Roman Catholics in the West with the largest Eastern Catholic Church. The Catholic Church in Ukraine was persecuted by the Soviets from 1946 to 1990; all of its activities were driven underground and its properties were confiscated. The UCEF Institutional Support Program helps educational and religious institutions in Ukraine to meet present needs and develop endowments for the future.</mission><charity_name>Ukrainian Catholic Education Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Acting President and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Guy Camarata</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5275</orgid><administration_expenses>298543.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>2</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.093000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>Chicago</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board                             </cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>0</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>60622</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0E-15</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>54.330000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.104000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>2656783.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.835000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>67.35</financial_score><street_address_1>2247 West Chicago Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>48.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Daniel Szymanski</current_ceo_name><ein>364126296</ein><total_expenses>3180572.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.070000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>4861747.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>225246.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Rebuilding the Church in Ukraine</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.490000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5275/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
