Microfinance provides small loans, savings, and other financial services so poor people can launch businesses. As an entrepreneur's business grows, so does her self-esteem, her family's well-being, and jobs in her community. GF was founded in 1997 by individuals inspired by Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank, Nobel Peace Prize laureates. Our mission is to enable the poor, especially the poorest, to create a world without poverty. GF's work has helped families across Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East.</mission><charity_name>Grameen Foundation USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Paul Maritz</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7723</orgid><administration_expenses>3798137.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.171000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20005</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.016000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>62.970000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.177000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>18142525.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.818000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.07</financial_score><street_address_1>1101 15th St, NW</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>3rd Floor</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Alex Counts</current_ceo_name><ein>731502797</ein><total_expenses>22175245.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.010000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>27375649.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>234583.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Empowering people.
