It has since worked with indigenous communities in Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Australia, becoming the leading US-based organization defending the rights of indigenous peoples around the world. Our efforts are guided by a board of directors that includes some of the world's preeminent indigenous leaders, as well as anthropologists, philanthropists, and entrepreneurs, and our executive director is a renowned human rights lawyer. Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Cultural Survival also has a satellite office for our Guatemala Radio Project in Guatemala.</mission><charity_name>Cultural Survival</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Sarah Fuller</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10875</orgid><administration_expenses>105634.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.065000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Public Benefit</category><city>Cambridge</city><cob_title>President and Chair of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>02139</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.242000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.320000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Advocacy and Civil Rights</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.158000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>1377257.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.853000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>58.24</financial_score><street_address_1>215 Prospect Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Suzanne Benally</current_ceo_name><ein>237182593</ein><total_expenses>1612758.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.080000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>226542.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>129867.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Defending the rights of indigenous peoples around the world</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.140000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10875/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
