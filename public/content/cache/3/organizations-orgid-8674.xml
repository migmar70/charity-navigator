Since the founding of the organization in 1988, CO has touched the lives of over 14,000 children in Egypt. We equip children who have lost a father with resources to access their basic rights through a church-based network in the Not Alone program; build self-esteem in girls at risk of dropping out of school through The Valuable Girl Project; connect youth from around the globe to Egypt in Serve to Learn; and support the education, health, and practical training of disabled, orphaned, and other disadvantaged children through our Grassroots Partner Initiatives.</mission><charity_name>Coptic Orphans</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Amira Roess</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8674</orgid><administration_expenses>370754.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.099000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Merrifield</city><cob_title>Chairperson</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>22116</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.190000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>64.210000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>VA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.140000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>3088286.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.827000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>65.77</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
