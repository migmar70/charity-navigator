In these remote regions people often live without basic health care and education. Economic pressures have forced environmental degradation, and traditional ways of life are in danger of disappearing. The American Himalayan Foundation was founded 25 years ago to respond to some of these pressing problems. Our work includes building schools, planting trees, training doctors, funding hospitals, taking care of children and elderly, and restoring sacred sites throughout the Himalayas. AHF supports projects that are on a human scale and that directly benefit people. We deeply respect our partners in the Himalayas and our work responds to their priorities and concerns.</mission><charity_name>American Himalayan Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Richard C.
