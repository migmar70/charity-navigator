The 24-bed shelter, Marquis House, is open all day, every day, and houses approximately 100 families with children each year (about 120 adults and over 200 children). The four-unit Transitional Housing project provides low-cost rental housing with supportive services. FESCO offers a full range of basic and support services to help families get off the streets, off welfare, and on their feet. FESCO also operates a multi-unit community living center called Banyan House.</mission><charity_name>Family Emergency Shelter Coalition</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Bob Peppler</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8850</orgid><administration_expenses>213011.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.179000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Hayward</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94541</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.020000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>50.550000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Homeless Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.053000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>874086.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.738000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>43.41</financial_score><street_address_1>21455 Birch Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Box 5</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Cate Steane</current_ceo_name><ein>943029991</ein><total_expenses>1183577.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.081000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>356556.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>96480.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>The family shelter</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.300000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8850/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
