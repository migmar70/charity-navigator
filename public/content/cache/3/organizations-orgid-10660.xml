The fund aims to serve the poorest countries of the world. Poor, rural and indigenous communities not only suffer most the consequences of shifts in rainfall, rising seas, and increased climate variability, they are also the most vulnerable due to economic and environmental policies of the countries in which they live. </mission><charity_name>Global Greengrants Fund</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director and CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Mele Lau-Smith</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10660</orgid><administration_expenses>268026.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.036000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Boulder</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>80301</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.053000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>60.440000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CO</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.128000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>6635049.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.891000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>57.09</financial_score><street_address_1>2840 Wilderness Place</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite A</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Terry Odendahl</current_ceo_name><ein>841612422</ein><total_expenses>7444635.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.072000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>4132687.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>541560.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Supporting passionate people with great ideas</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.550000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10660/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
