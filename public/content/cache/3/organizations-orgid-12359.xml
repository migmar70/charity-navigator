What started as a very personal incident between two mothers has become a tremendous initiative for change. With over 4,000 children and family members on ARV treatment, over 250,000 people under our care, three orphanages receiving funding, and major clinic sites in expansion, Keep a Child Alive is making a direct impact in the lives of so many who need help.</mission><charity_name>Keep a Child Alive</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, Founder</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Michael Guido</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12359</orgid><administration_expenses>274887.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.056000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Brooklyn</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>11201</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.051000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>69.100000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.156000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>4272747.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.873000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.73</financial_score><street_address_1>45 Main Street</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 720</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Leigh Blake</current_ceo_name><ein>731682844</ein><total_expenses>4892780.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.070000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2069613.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>345146.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Providing life-saving anti-retroviral treatment, care and support services</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.420000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12359/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
