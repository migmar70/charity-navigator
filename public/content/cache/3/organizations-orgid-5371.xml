KFB serves over 400 agencies in 86 Kansas counties distributing over 4.5 million pounds of food each year. These counties cover more than 73,000 square miles in Kansas. KFB works with other America's Second Harvest agencies to share large quantities of food that any one food bank could not distribute alone.</mission><charity_name>Kansas Food Bank</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Doug Jenkins</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5371</orgid><administration_expenses>128823.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.009000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Wichita</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board                             </cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>67211</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.142000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>62.920000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>KS</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.158000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>13782671.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.976000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>69.76</financial_score><street_address_1>1919 East Douglas Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>60.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Brian Walker</current_ceo_name><ein>480959213</ein><total_expenses>14118582.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.014000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>10914167.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>207088.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Rescuing food, helping people, since 1984</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.750000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5371/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
