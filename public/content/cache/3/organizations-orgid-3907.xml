We believe that women everywhere must have the opportunity to determine their futures, care for their families and manage their fertility. Along with caring, committed health professionals and other colleagues worldwide, Ipas tackles this neglected public-health problem head-on in some of the world's poorest countries. While many international donors and governments have focused attention and resources elsewhere, we struggle against the fundamental social injustice that results in the deaths of so many women in the primes of their lives.</mission><charity_name>Ipas</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Amy O.
