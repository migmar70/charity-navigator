HRF protects people at risk: refugees who flee persecution, victims of crimes against humanity or other mass human rights violations, victims of discrimination, those whose rights are eroded in the name of national security, and human rights advocates who are targeted for defending the rights of others. These groups are often the first victims of societal instability and breakdown; their treatment is a harbinger of wider-scale repression. HRF works to prevent violations against these groups and to seek justice and accountability for violations against them.</mission><charity_name>Human Rights First</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>William D.
