Founded in 1980, PETA is dedicated to establishing and defending the rights of all animals. PETA focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: on factory farms, in laboratories, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment industry. We also work on a variety of other issues, including the cruel killing of beavers, birds and other "pests", and the abuse of backyard dogs. PETA works through public education, cruelty investigations, research, animal rescue, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns.</mission><charity_name>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Ingrid E.
