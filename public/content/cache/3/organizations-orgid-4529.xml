Camp Boggy Creek is a permanent, year-round facility where children between the ages of 7-16 with chronic or life-threatening illnesses can come at no charge to them or their families. Camp Boggy Creek is specifically designed for children with chronic or life threatening illnesses and allows them to safely enjoy the activities of a traditional camp. Between early morning swims and evening campfires, children whose lives have been a series of medical procedures and hospital stays are transformed into just kids.</mission><charity_name>Camp Boggy Creek</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>J.
