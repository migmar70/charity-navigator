Bright Hope envisions a world where under-resourced, indigenous churches transform their communities and bring Hope to the extreme poor. Their efforts include a holistic program with physical aid, economic development and spiritual growth in each of their partnerships in Africa, Asia and Latin America. This aspect of their ministry is called Hope for today, tomorrow and eternity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following are types of assistance and support, depending on the needs of the local partners: disaster, crisis and refugee response; healthcare; food and water; education; orphan and vulnerable children care; job creation; micro-enterprise; infrastructure; agriculture programs; church planting; evangelism and church leadership development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</mission><charity_name>Bright Hope International</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President/CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jennifer King Soderquist</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5103</orgid><administration_expenses>589544.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.090000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Religion</category><city>Hoffman Estates</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>60169</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.154000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>65.310000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>IL</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Religious Activities</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.144000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>5677246.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.872000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>63.37</financial_score><street_address_1>2060 Stonington Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Craig Dyer</current_ceo_name><ein>237004991</ein><total_expenses>6507328.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.036000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1492244.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>240538.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Bringing Hope to those living on less than $1 a day.</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.220000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/5103/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
