Over the past 154 years, the Academy has grown to become the fourth largest natural history museum in the country. Home to Steinhart Aquarium, Morrison Planetarium, and the Kimball Natural History Museum, as well as world class research and education departments, the Academy's mission is to explore, explain, and protect the natural world. The new Academy is a single structure but contains multiple venues, including the aquarium, the planetarium, the natural history museum and the 4-story rainforest. The new building also houses the Academy science labs and administrative offices, including an extensive library and scientific archive consisting of more than 26 million specimens.</mission><charity_name>California Academy of Sciences</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>John C.
