The Foundation began with a very simple idea to convert what is considered waste in the western world into much needed help in the East. The idea became reality when good quality used clothes were collected and sent to orphanages and women's home in rural India. Medical supplies and equipment that were considered obsolete in the west but were a leap forward in remote areas were soon included in the shipments. These supplies dramatically improved the quality of care in charitable hospitals there.</mission><charity_name>Share and Care Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President &amp; CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Sharadkumar Shah</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8306</orgid><administration_expenses>65598.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.063000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Paramus</city><cob_title>Chairman, Board of Trustees</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>07652</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.221000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>51.120000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NJ</state><reportsceoandsalary>0</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.232000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>900240.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.875000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>48.64</financial_score><street_address_1>676 Winters Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>54.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jayant Shroff</current_ceo_name><ein>222458395</ein><total_expenses>1028749.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.061000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>1262045.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>62911.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Women's empowerment, youth development</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.220000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8306/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
