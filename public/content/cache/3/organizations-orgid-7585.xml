The program recognizes the special sacrifices of our men and women in uniform and the hardships of military service by meeting a humanitarian need beyond that normally provided by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. There is at least one Fisher House at every major military medical center to assist families in need and to ensure that they are provided with the comforts of home in a supportive environment. Annually, the Fisher House program serves more than 10,000 families, and have made available nearly 2.5 million days of lodging to family members since the program originated in 1990.</mission><charity_name>Fisher House Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Kenneth Fisher</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7585</orgid><administration_expenses>940015.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.013000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Human Services</category><city>Rockville</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20850</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.077000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>68.090000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>MD</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Social Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.392000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>68884770.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.980000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>67.30</financial_score><street_address_1>111 Rockville Pike</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 420</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>David Coker</current_ceo_name><ein>113158401</ein><total_expenses>70288968.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.006000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>48967210.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>464183.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Helping military families</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.680000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7585/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
