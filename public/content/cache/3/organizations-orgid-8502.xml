The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Arizona chapter is the founding Make-A-Wish Foundation chapter. There are currently 67 chapters in the U.S. and its territories and 27 international affiliates. Each year, the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Arizona grants around 200 wishes. We granted our 3,000th wish in May of 2007. Children who have been diagnosed by their physician as having a life- threatening medical condition, and who are between 2 1/2 - 18 years of age, are eligible for a wish. Our objective is to provide the child and family members with joyful memories and time that is as worry-free as possible.</mission><charity_name>Make-A-Wish Foundation of Arizona</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Michael Tully</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8502</orgid><administration_expenses>312653.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.076000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Phoenix</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>85020</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.130000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>59.430000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>AZ</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Patient and Family Support</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.194000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3233554.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.790000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>55.06</financial_score><street_address_1>711 East Northern Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Elizabeth Reich</current_ceo_name><ein>860409636</ein><total_expenses>4088643.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.132000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>224850.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>542436.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Share the power of a wish</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0E-15</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8502/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
