Established in 1982, FFP's goals are to improve the health, economic, social and spiritual conditions of the men, women and children we serve. Food For The Poor raises funds and provides direct relief assistance to the poor, usually by purchasing specifically requested materials and distributing them through the churches and charity organizations already operating in areas of need. Since its founding FFP has distributed more than 48,000 tractor-trailer loads of aid to the poor. We have also built more than 55,000 housing units for people desperately in need of adequate shelter, and completed more than 750 water projects that provide lifesaving water and sanitation to hundreds of thousands of villagers in need.</mission><charity_name>Food For The Poor</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>P.
