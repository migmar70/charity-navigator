CAAF makes a positive difference in the lives of children infected with HIV and affected by AIDS. CAAF accomplishes this by helping meet their diverse special needs, advocating and educating on their behalf, and brining joy and fun into their lives. CAAF is the only organization solely devoted to providing social, educational, recreation and other critical support programs to vulnerable children impacted by HIV/AIDS in the U.S. and other countries.</mission><charity_name>Children Affected by AIDS Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Joe Cristina</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>7934</orgid><administration_expenses>84172.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.051000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Los Angeles</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>90045</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.001000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>56.730000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Diseases, Disorders, and Disciplines</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.044000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1458427.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.886000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>57.52</financial_score><street_address_1>6033 West Century Boulevard</street_address_1><accountability_score>56.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 280</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>John Gile</current_ceo_name><ein>954448687</ein><total_expenses>1644647.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.062000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>226533.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>102048.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Making a positive difference in the lives of children affected by AIDS</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.130000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/7934/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
