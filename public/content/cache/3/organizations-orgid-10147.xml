Migdal Ohr, located in Northern Israel, is the world's largest Jewish youth village, serving 6,500 children. For more than 35 years, our organization has been transforming the lives of children from impoverished and disadvantaged homes, where the basic need for shelter, safety, and love could not be met. We provide boys and girls ages one month through 18 years with the priceless opportunity to experience family, live each day with a sense of wellbeing, and gain the education and skills needed to feel safe and live productive, rewarding lives. Founded in 1972 by Israel Prize laureate Rabbi Yitzchak David Grossman, Migdal Ohr has provided a loving and nurturing home for thousands of children at risk, and has received numerous awards and salutations from the government of Israel.</mission><charity_name>American Friends of Migdal Ohr</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Max Thurm</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10147</orgid><administration_expenses>411820.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>3</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.084000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>New York</city><cob_title>Chairman</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>10036</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.029000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.310000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>NY</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Foreign Charity Support Organizations</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.004000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>3930005.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.811000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>49.13</financial_score><street_address_1>1560 Broadway</street_address_1><accountability_score>59.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 510</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Evan Bernstein</current_ceo_name><ein>133389558</ein><total_expenses>4845796.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.104000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>2796493.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>503971.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>The magic of caring</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.570000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>0</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/10147/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
