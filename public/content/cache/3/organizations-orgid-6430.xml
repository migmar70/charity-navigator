The purpose of GPFD is to bring outside resources to communities that struggle with the innumerable problems associated with hunger and poverty, and to assist those communities in bringing about appropriate development, improved health, education, and economic self-reliance. GPFD builds partnerships, matching people and resources with community development projects for the purpose of advancing the health and well being of humanity. GPFD has been working on projects that have included development of clean water sources, child nutrition, medical and health care, education, and women's economic self-reliance.</mission><charity_name>Global Partners for Development</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Don Harris</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6430</orgid><administration_expenses>86425.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.058000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Rohnert Park</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>94928</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.191000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>53.300000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Humanitarian Relief Supplies</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.185000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1271198.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.861000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>0</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>48.61</financial_score><street_address_1>320 Professional Center Drive</street_address_1><accountability_score>60.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 120</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Catherine Kirby</current_ceo_name><ein>942537375</ein><total_expenses>1474819.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>2</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.079000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>361017.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>117196.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Ending poverty, through the power of partnership</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.230000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>0</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6430/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
