Concern America trains local populations in health, education, agriculture, and/or environmental health (appropriate technology), and accompanies these populations from eight to ten years, working with and through them to build local, functional social systems that meet their basic needs. Eventually, the Concern America team can be withdrawn, leaving in place trained local people who are capacitated to continue the work and to bring it to neighboring communities.</mission><charity_name>Concern America</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Marty Trujillo</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>10614</orgid><administration_expenses>192424.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.180000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Santa Ana</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>92702</zip><primary_revenue_growth>-0.064000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>44.540000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.110000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>2</overall_rating><program_expenses>744491.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.697000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>34.23</financial_score><street_address_1>P.O.
