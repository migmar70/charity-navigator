Since its founding, SOS Children's Villages International has expanded to almost 500 villages in 132 countries. We are currently raising over 73,000 children in our villages and through our many education, family strengthening, medical, and outreach programs, we impact the lives of over 1 million people each year. We work for children who are orphaned, abandoned or whose families are unable to care for them. We give these children the opportunity to build lasting relationships within an SOS family. We enable children to live according to their own culture and religion, and to be active members of the community.</mission><charity_name>SOS Children's Villages-USA</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Acting CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>John Allen</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8016</orgid><administration_expenses>508737.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.071000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>Washington</city><cob_title>President</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>20005</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.062000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>56.380000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>DC</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.107000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>5547892.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.781000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>52.06</financial_score><street_address_1>1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.</street_address_1><accountability_score>63.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1250</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>John Allen</current_ceo_name><ein>136188433</ein><total_expenses>7101202.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.147000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>-581761.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>1044573.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Loving homes for children in 132 countries</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>-0.090000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8016/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
