Plant With Purpose and its Dominican sister organization, Floresta Incorporada, were founded in 1984 out of a new vision for economic development that would be sustainable and benefit the environment. Plant With Purpose sought to make lasting change through development that restored productivity to degraded land and dignity to the rural poor, while providing opportunities for upcoming generations. Currently there are over 2,000 families who are benefiting from Plant With Purpose's program in Haiti, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Thailand, Burundi and Tanzania: receiving loans, training in sustainable agriculture and reforestation, assistance in community organizing, capacity building, and marketing assistance.</mission><charity_name>Plant With Purpose</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Catherine Lundy</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>6907</orgid><administration_expenses>252327.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.087000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>International</category><city>San Diego</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>92117</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.079000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>64.440000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Development and Relief Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.089000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2375095.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.823000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>62.15</financial_score><street_address_1>4903 Morena Boulevard</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 1215</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Scott Sabin</current_ceo_name><ein>330052976</ein><total_expenses>2884925.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.089000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>512361.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>257503.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Environmental Solutions to Humanitarian Problems</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.150000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/6907/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
