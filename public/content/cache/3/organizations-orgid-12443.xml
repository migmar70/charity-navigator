Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation was started by her parents in 2005 to continue the work that Alex began. Our mission is simple: to raise money for and awareness of childhood cancer cause - especially research into new treatments and cures - and to encourage and educate others, especially children, to get involved and make a difference for children with cancer. The money we've raised has helped us to: fund more than 150 cutting-edge research projects; create a travel program to help support families of children receiving treatment; and develop resources to help people everywhere touched by childhood cancer.</mission><charity_name>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Stephen Cohn</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>0</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>12443</orgid><administration_expenses>786594.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.098000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Wynnewood</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>19096</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.174000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>66.940000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>PA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Diseases, Disorders, and Disciplines</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.132000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>6668197.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.837000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>68.37</financial_score><street_address_1>333 East Lancaster Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 414</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Jay Scott &amp; Liz Scott</current_ceo_name><ein>562496146</ein><total_expenses>7961332.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.063000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>11413848.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>506541.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Fighting childhood cancer, one cup at a time</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>1.430000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/12443/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
