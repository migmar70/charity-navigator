Our mission is to strengthen disaster response in America by recruiting rescued dogs and partnering them with firefighters and other first responders to find people buried alive in the wreckage of disasters. We offer the professionally trained canines and an ongoing training program at no cost to fire departments. And we ensure lifetime care for every dog in our program: once rescued, these dogs never need to be rescued again. There are currently 73 SDF-trained Search Teams across the country, located in California, Florida, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska, Utah and Baja California. Thanks to Mutual Aid Agreements between counties, cities and states, these precious, life-saving resources can be shared regionally and nationally.</mission><charity_name>National Disaster Search Dog Foundation</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Executive Director</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Chris Wright</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>9203</orgid><administration_expenses>325175.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.110000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Animals</category><city>Ojai</city><cob_title>Board Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>93023</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.306000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.890000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.189000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2172758.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.735000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>62.35</financial_score><street_address_1>501 East Ojai Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>66.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Debra Tosch</current_ceo_name><ein>770412509</ein><total_expenses>2952635.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.153000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>7111945.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>454702.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Be part of the search</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>2.400000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/9203/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
