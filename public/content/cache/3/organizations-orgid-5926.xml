Zero prostate cancer cases and for those with prostate cancer it means a zero PSA. Our name conveys what we stand for zero tolerance for prostate cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As ZERO - The End of Prostate Cancer, we commit ourselves not only to reduce prostate cancer or alleviate the pain from the disease but to end it. We see a future where all men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer will be cured or manage their illness with good quality of life, with the support they need to minimize physical and emotional suffering and to cope effectively throughout their cancer journeys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To accomplish our goal, we provide comprehensive treatment information to patients, education to those at risk and conduct free prostate cancer testing throughout the country. We increase research funds from the federal government to find new treatments and we fund local grants to end the disease. </mission><charity_name>ZERO - The End of Prostate Cancer</charity_name><current_ceo_title>Chief Executive Officer</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Jonathan Schwartz</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>5926</orgid><administration_expenses>99252.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.044000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Alexandria</city><cob_title>Chairman of the Board</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>22314</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.038000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>58.590000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>VA</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Diseases, Disorders, and Disciplines</cause><program_expenses_growth>-0.006000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>3</overall_rating><program_expenses>1965551.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.873000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>53.87</financial_score><street_address_1>515 King Street, Suite 420</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2></street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Quention </current_ceo_name><ein>593400922</ein><total_expenses>2250511.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>3</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.082000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>538902.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>185708.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Zero prostate cancer deaths.
