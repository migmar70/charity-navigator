Since being founded in 1983, the chapter has granted more than 3,300 wishes to eligible Colorado children. The Foundation will consider the wish of any child diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition who is between the ages of 2-1/2 and 18 and lives anywhere in the state of Colorado. The entire family is included in the child's magical wish. The wish is a time which provides joy, respite and family healing and is a time when the focus is not on the child's illness. The magic we provide by granting a wish gets the whole family out of the hospital and offers them a time of fun and togetherness.</mission><charity_name>Make-A-Wish Foundation of Colorado</charity_name><current_ceo_title>President, CEO</current_ceo_title><cob_name>Beau Stark</cob_name><auditedfinancial_status>1</auditedfinancial_status><orgid>8496</orgid><administration_expenses>338993.00</administration_expenses><accountability_rating>4</accountability_rating><administration_expenses_ratio>0.119000000000000</administration_expenses_ratio><category>Health</category><city>Greenwood Village</city><cob_title>Chair</cob_title><materialdiversionofassets>1</materialdiversionofassets><conflictofinterestpolicy>1</conflictofinterestpolicy><zip>80111</zip><primary_revenue_growth>0.130000000000000</primary_revenue_growth><overall_score>63.210000000000000</overall_score><loanstoofficers>1</loanstoofficers><state>CO</state><reportsceoandsalary>1</reportsceoandsalary><boardcomposition>1</boardcomposition><compensatesboard>1</compensatesboard><cause>Patient and Family Support</cause><program_expenses_growth>0.206000000000000</program_expenses_growth><overall_rating>4</overall_rating><program_expenses>2250645.00</program_expenses><program_expenses_ratio>0.790000000000000</program_expenses_ratio><stafflist_status>1</stafflist_status><boardlist_status>1</boardlist_status><financial_score>60.40</financial_score><street_address_1>7951 East Maplewood Avenue</street_address_1><accountability_score>70.00</accountability_score><street_address_2>Suite 126</street_address_2><current_ceo_name>Joan Mazak</current_ceo_name><ein>742273004</ein><total_expenses>2845496.00</total_expenses><financial_rating>4</financial_rating><fundraising_expenses_ratio>0.089000000000000</fundraising_expenses_ratio><boardmeetingminutes>1</boardmeetingminutes><total_net_assets>918734.00</total_net_assets><fundraising_expenses>255858.00</fundraising_expenses><tag_line>Share the power of a wish</tag_line><independentaudit>1</independentaudit><working_capital_ratio>0.320000000000000</working_capital_ratio><ceocompensationprocedure>1</ceocompensationprocedure><form990_status>1</form990_status><loanstoorfromofficers>1</loanstoorfromofficers><resource_uri>http://api.charitynavigator.org/api/v1/organizations/8496/</resource_uri></object></objects></response>
